Good point.  I opine AFFIRM in in CFJ 2451a.  While the defendant has
a right not to be penalized twice for the same act, penalties should
be counted according to the appropriateness to the severity of the
violation, not the literal number of times a penalty was applied.  In
this case, the total penalty that has been dealt comes to four rests,
which is within the 2-6 rests that R1504 allows for the offense, and
so it is reasonable to aggregately view it as a single penalty.

On the other hand, if this penalty were to be overturned and replaced
with DISCHARGE, then the defendant would effectively be receiving only
1 rest for breaking a power-3 rule, which is not within the prescribed
range.  It is true that e would be receiving that rest for a power-1
violation instead of the power-3 violation, but where a defendant has
committed multiple violations by the same action, I hold that e should
be penalized according to the most severe violation, not the least.

In closing, I'll note that even without the above legal theorizing,
this sentence does not violate the defendant's right not to be
penalized twice for the same action, because there were in fact six
such actions.  According to this alternative reasoning, the first rest
stems from the first violation, the three from CFJ 2451 are for the
second violation, and the final four violations remain unprosecuted.

Panelist Rodlen's Arguments:

Recognizing that there were six violations of the rule, therefore allowing a
punishment for each, I opine AFFIRM.
