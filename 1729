Caller's Arguments:

In message <46CA8594.1010007@optusnet.com.au> The Host purportedly awarded
Levi 10 points in each of ten contests.  I do not dispute the existence
of the contests or the validity of Levi acting on behalf of The Host.
Rule 2136 says:

      A contestmaster may award a total of up to 10 points per week to
      one or more contestants as permitted by the contest, unless e
      was contestmaster of a different contest for at least 3 days of
      the previous week.

This means that The Host may award a total of up to 10 points per week.
(The Host wasn't doing anything last week, so the clause after the comma
doesn't affect anything.)  I interpret "may" as indicating exclusive
possibility here.  Thus, I claim, The Host succeeded in awarding Levi 10
points in Host Contest 1 and then, having awarded eir maximum 10 points,
was incapable of awarding any more this week.  I therefore propose a
judgement of FALSE.

========================================================================

Judge root's Arguments:

Rule 2136 reads in part:

      A contest is an agreement that identifies itself as such, and
      identifies exactly one party as its contestmaster; all other
      parties are its contestants.

A contestmaster is thus specific to a particular contest, and The Host
is thus a contestmaster ten times over.  I therefore do not find any
inconsistency between The Host's point awards and the portion of R2136
cited by Initiator Zefram, as The Host was acting as a different
contestmaster for each point award.  I therefore submit a judgement of
TRUE for CFJ 1729.
