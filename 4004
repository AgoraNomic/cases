Caller's Arguments:

Obviously, Ministry Focus is not defined anywhere. If these
terms had an ordinary meaning they would take it, but I think they should
be discounted as meaningless gibberish. What's left is the fact that a
player can grant someone a Device once a month. What it means to 'grant'
someone a Device is difficult, but the ordinary meaning of the term is to
give ownership. And if I own a Device, it would seem I could activate some
of the powers of Devices, as ownership usually grants control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge ais523's Arguments:

In order to resolve this CFJ, we need to be clear on what a device
actually is. Rule 2654 has somehow managed to avoid defining it.
However, rule 2655 does contain a definition: "The device is a
singleton switch with values off (default) and on."

It's clear from this definition that there was, at one time, only one
device, and it would be hard to create more without a rule permitting
it (and such a rule would probably have to take precedence over the
implication in rule 2655 that there were only one such device).
Although rule 2654 could potentially be read as permitting the creation
of devices, it also gives a lot of requirements on how this is done
(e.g. it requires a vote, and must be made via an unpredictable
process) – those requirements don't seem to have been satisfied here,
and thus a device can't have been created. I think this argument is
strong enough to interpret rule 2654 via using an interpretation in
which "granting" Devices isn't a method of creating them (either
directly, or at worst via a rule 217 tiebreak); however, even if I'm
wrong on this, rule 2240 implies that rule 2654's requirements on how
to create a Device take precedence over any permission it might give to
create one.

In other words, the only way this CFJ could be true would be if rule
2654 somehow grants ownership and control of *the existing* device, the
one that's a singleton switch. When we talk about possession of
switches, normally we're talking about the entity that that switch
pertains to, e.g. "ais523's registration switch" is the switch that
controls whether I'm a player or not. Rule 2162 defines "singleton
switch" as "a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only entity
possessing an instance of that switch.", also using "possession"
terminology. Thus, it's clear that ownership of the device previously
resided with Agora, and thus the "ownership" part of the CFJ statement
collapses to "I have taken possession of the device from Agora.".

Although rule 2655 defines the device as belonging to Agora, rule 2654
has higher precedence (by rule 1030 – same power, lower ID number), and
thus can override it if necessary. However, the relevant part of rule
2654 seems to have a requirement on the device's previous owner:
{{{
      A player CAN once a month grant eir Ministry Focus' Device to
      a specified player by announcement.
]}}
This is clearly using possessive language, so this grant can only work
if the device belongs to the player's Ministry Focus. As mentioned, the
device was previously posessed by Agora (by definition, Agora was the
only entity possessing a device!), so for the "I now own..." part of
the statement to be valid, the caller's Ministry Focus would have to be
Agora – otherwise, the stated conditions required to perform the action
wouldn't be met and therefore the action can't be taken.

As the caller mentions, "Ministry Focus" is currently undefined, but it
doesn't make sense to interpret "eir Ministry Focus'" as "the".
Instead, I think it's fairly obvious that the caller currently doesn't
have a defined Ministry Focus (given that nothing is defining it, and
that attempting to define it would affect the operation of a power-1
rule and thus can't be done by anything with power less than 1), and
thus it is not the case that the caller's Ministry Focus is Agora. As
such, the caller's action failed entirely, because the requirements to
perform it weren't met.

In conclusion, the caller doesn't currently own a device, and that's
logically sufficient to make the CFJ statement false.

I judge CFJ 4004 FALSE.
