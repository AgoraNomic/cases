Judge's Arguments:

There is no substantial evidence that Wes is any other player. The
statements made by the Agoran veterans that were referred to by Kolja A.
did not seem to be made with any kind of sincerity, nor with any real basis,
other than the coincidence of registration times. Moreover, Wes's behavior,
as Kolja A. pointed out, is consistent with a person who is not familiar
with recent Agoran history.

I believe that if there were a substatial piece of evidence, such as an
admission from Wes or a series of events which demonstrate very unreasonable
cooperation between two players, the issue should be carefully examined.
However, since there is no real indication that Wes is another player, I
must return a judgement of FALSE.

=====================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

The underlying question is whether Wes is a new player, or whether e
is Scott (or some other player) reregistered with a new nickname (if
e is, the time since the last deregistration isn't long enough to
deserve a fresh grace period, see R1676). I'm honestly confused and
not sure what to think: there have been several allegations from
Agora veterans that the same real life person may be behind General
Chaos and Wes. Wes has, so far, made no unambiguous statement denying

this. On the other hand, Wes is (or are ;) behaving very much like
someone who hasn't been in the game for some time.

The identity of the real life person behind a player is an important
thing, because active players registering dummies in addition to
their 'original' player could severely hurt the balance of the game.
This is not an issue in the present case, as General Chaos isn't
registered anymore, so I believe now is a good opportunity to think
about how we determine a player's identity. Apparently, at the moment

we simply believe what players say, because that's all we can do. I
don't mind that as long as what players say is unambiguous...

I hope Wes will not take offence at this CFJ, and I'm not saying that

it must be judged true. But I'd like to a) know what's going on here
and b) have the situation officially clarified.
