    Before immibis decided to no longer agree to 'that agreement',
    ais523 could act on behalf of immibis to cause em to register.

Caller's Arguments:

In myndzi's case, e didn't know much about nomic, nor
expected anything like this to happen. immibis installed a
similarly-behaving script deliberately as a test, although I'm not sure
exactly what e was trying to test.

Also, 'agreeement' is probably a R754-equivalent for 'agreement'

Judge scshunt's Arguments:

2599 has the same judgment as 2598 as R101 says that no contract is
formed without explicit, willful consent. Therefore if inmibis (sp?)
agreed to the contract, e had no way out.

In the circumstances, it is clear eir consent was willful as e
specifically encouraged ais523 to try binding emself to a contract in
##nomic. Furthermore, the text was very explicit. However, we must
realize that the consent required by R101 does not mean the person has
to say explicitly that e consents - rather, e performs some action
explicitly to indicate eir consent (consent may be implicit, but only
if the implication is caused explicitly.) Therefore, the fact that the
script provided an explicit text is immaterial.

It is unclear if inmibis ever truly intended to be bound, thus e
lacked explicit consent. As such, I judge these CFJs to both be FALSE.
