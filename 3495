======================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

We can address it in two parts:

1. A non-player can hold an office.

2. A non-player can judge judgements.

The first appears to be true. Rule 1006 sets out the requirements of
an Officeholder:

> Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with possible
> values of any person or "vacant”.

However, it goes on to restrict the duration for which a non-player
may hold an office:

> If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it becomes vacant

Thus it is impossible for a non-player to ever take action under an
office, or to hold an office for any non-zero length of time. It may
be possible for a non-player to interrupt the occupancy of an office,
but it is not possible for a non-player to hold an office.

The second is more complicated.

Rule 991 allows the Arbitor to assign only players to a CFJ:

> When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any player
> to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so within a week.

(It also sets out some criteria restricting the set of eligible 
players.)

However, no rule requires that a judge be recused if they cease to be
a player, and Rule 591 allows the assigned judge to deliver judgement
regardless of eir status as a player:

> When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN assign
> a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so in a
> timely fashion after this becomes possible.

It is indisputably possible for a player to cease being a player -
by deregistration, for example - between being assigned to a CFJ and
assigning judgement to it. As the rules make no provision for this
case, by Rule 2125, it is unregulated:

> The Rules SHALL NOT be interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated
> actions.

Therefore, under narrow but possible circumstances, a non-player can
judge judgements.

Thus, a non-player cannot hold an office, but can judge judgments.
