[For reference: the Device is currently off.]

I perform the following sequence of actions 100 times:
{{{
Without 3 objections, I assign the Device to myself. [This would fail
if the Device had an assigned judge.]

I act on behalf of the Device to cause the Device to deactivate emself.

I withdraw 1 Win Card and 3 Winsomes from Obstructive Pooling. [This
does not cause any Win Cards or Winsomes to change hands, because I am
the Trustee, but destroys 55 Decipoints in my possession as a side
effect.]

I transfer the Obstructive Pooling Trust to Jason by transferring 38
Winsomes to Jason. [There were 56+271+108 = 435 Decipoints in existence
prior to this message; I destroyed 55 of them to leave 380 Decipoints,
so to be able to transfer the Trust, I need to transfer assest with a
total value of 380 Decipoints, and Winsomes are worth 10 Decipoints
each.]

I perform the following actions (disclaimer: if I failed to assign the
Device to myself 100 times, they will be impossible):
{{{
I perform the following action 25 times: {{I pay 4 Win Cards as a set
to gain 10 Winsomes.}}

I Take Over The Economy.
}}}


these excerpts from rule 2654:
{{{
   When the device is on:
[...]
     * A Device CAN activate or deactivate emself by announcement.
[...]
   When the device is off:
[...]
     * If a Device has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
       judge that Device CAN assign it to emself without 3
       objections.
     * Then, the Device changes, following which each active player
       gains 1 card of each type and eir grant (if any).
[...]
}}}
and from rule 2124:
{{{
   An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the
   Speaker hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, and its
   conditions, if any, are met.

   An intent is mature if it was tabled at least 4 days ago and
   nobody withdrew objections from it in the past 24 hours.

   A rule purporting to allow a person to perform a tabled action
   allows em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents
   for that action/method combination:
   * With N Support: e is a sponsor or supporter of a ripe intent with
     at least N supporters.
   * Without N Objections: e is a sponsor of a mature ripe intent with
     less than N objectors.
   * With N Agoran Consent: e is a sponsor or supporter of a mature
     ripe intent with supporters greater than N times its objectors
     (e SHOULD list supporters and objectors).
   * With T notice: e is the sponsor of a ripe intent created at
     least T ago.
}}}


Caller's Arguments:

As I think has been discussed on the list before, after the recent
change to the tabled actions rule, it appears that you can take a
tabled action multiple times from a single intent. (The wording of the
rule is fairly clear on the requirements, and "not having used the same
intent to take the action before" is not mentioned.) Recent game custom
also implies this – people have been objecting to attempts to take
fairly innocuous actions that would have been quite dangerous if
repeated many times.

The main question, therefore, is whether I can succeed 100 times in
assigning the Device to myself. A power-1 rule says that I CAN, and no
rule seems to imply that I can't, as long as "[the] Device has no judge
assigned". (I also need to be eligible to judge the Device, but I am
eligible to judge generally, and there is no reason why the Device
would be a special case.) If I do succeed in doing this successfully,
then everyone gains 100 of every Card, and I win as a result of being
able to convert my Win Cards to Winsomes faster than everyone else can.

We therefore need to interpret what it means for the device to have a
judge assigned. I can see three main possibilities: either there isn't
any way for this to occur, and thus the Device is never in a state of
having a judge assigned (even though it is possible to assign the
Device to a person, this is distinct from assigning the person to the
Device); or else the action of assigning the device to a person causes
the person to become an assigned judge for that Device (which is how
the Arbitor interpreted it, possibly as a counterscam attempt); or else
the concept of a judge being assigned to a Device is a concept that's
based on the mental state of the Arbitor (i.e. the Arbitor considers
that player to be the primary judge for the Device).

With the first interpretation, this sequence of actions obviously
works.

With the second interpretation, there's some inclarity because the
"device changes" as a consequence of being assigned, which would turn
it on (the Device is a switch with two states, so changing it would
presumably cause it to change state) – and that causes the part of the
rule about judge assignment to Devices to turn off, so it may cause the
assignment to disappear in the same way that repealing the rules
defining something normally cause that thing to disappear.

With the third interpretation, the Arbitor has stated that e will
assign CFJs about the Device to me if my intent is successful; however,
this assignment policy is reliant on the Arbitor being aware that the
intent has gone through (if someone called a CFJ about the Device after
I sent this message, but the Arbitor happened to read the message
containing the CFJ and assign it before e read this message, e would
not have any reason to assign the CFJ to me specifically), so the
required mental state in the Arbitor comes about only after e has
received this message, and thus I'm not assigned to the Device until
after the message has ended. (Incidentally, I'm a little dubious that
this interpretation can be correct because it would seem to violate
rule 2140, in that the meaning of "a judge is assigned to a device"
would appear to be a substantive aspect of the Device rule, and the
Arbitor does not have enough power to change that.)

I'd like the judge to rule on which interpretation of the Device rule
is correct, in addition to ruling on whether or not I won as a result
of this message – as usual with this sort of rule, the wording can
often lead to interesting questions of interpretation because it was
originally intended for a different context.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge secretsnail's Arguments:

There's a lot to go into here, so I'll go in order of the actions taken.

"Without 3 objections, I assign the Device to myself. [This would fail
if the Device had an assigned judge.]"

This succeeds the first time, according to the tabled action rules, and
should also succeed any subsequent times if the device has no assigned
judge by those same rules, as ais523 "is a sponsor of a mature ripe intent
with less than [3] objectors." But this only applies if the device is off,
as that is when the tabled action is allowed.

After the first device assignment, "the Device changes, following which
each active player gains 1 card of each type and eir grant (if any)". What
does it mean for the device to change? We actually have a definition for a
device change:

"A Device change is any effect that falls into the above
          classes."

but this only applies when the device is on, so the device changing is
undefined at this point. The device has multiple properties that could
change, including its assigned judge, its value, and potentially other
attributes. There is nothing that specifies what is to be changed about the
device, and where the text is silent, Rule 217 applies. Common sense seems
to indicate the first choice for what a change is is to turn the device
from off to on, or vice versa. It seems there is no other indication as to
what should change about the device, so if something has to change, which
it should for the best interest of the game in order to resolve ambiguity,
it would be the device's value, to on. Similar arguments plus a previous
judgement apply to the deactivation of the device.

When ais523 attempts to assign the device to emself the second time, we
need to look with more scrutiny. What happened the first time?

If a Device has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
          judge that Device CAN assign it to emself without 3
          objections.

So ais523 assigned the device to emself. Does that mean the device has a
judge assigned?  ais523 is certainly a judge, as e has judged multiple
CFJs. So the device is assigned to a judge. This certainly implies the
device has a judge assigned, but that is not explicit, the text is silent
and unclear, and Rule 217 applies.

The condition is if the device has a judge assigned, but it doesn't specify
if the judge is assigned to the device or if the device is assigned to you,
which implies it's equating the two. The condition would also always be
true if the assignment wasn't symmetrical, when the action is implied to be
only supposed to be taken once; being able to take the action multiple
times just defies common sense: A device assigned to a judge has a judge
assigned. Game custom supports this, as the phrase "has no judge assigned"
wasn't explicitly coded in Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) either, yet we
agree it works that way. It is concealed, but unambiguous, because the
choice was already previously made to equate the two.

So ais523 is the judge assigned, that the device has, and 99 of eir
attempts failed, both for the assignments and the deactivations (as the
device remained off), so all of eir attempts at cashing in sets of cards
failed. As such, e did not have enough winsomes to Take Over the Economy. I
judge CFJ 3964 FALSE.


With eligibility concerns:

"The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all active
      players except the initiator and the person barred (if any)."

This part of Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) pretty clearly was only meant
to apply for CFJs, but the device doesn't care about that. It says:

If a Device has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
          judge that Device CAN assign it to emself without 3
          objections.


Using that key word, eligible, which this time, we actually have a
definition for. Now what we don't have defined for the device is who the
initiator and the person barred are. Again the next is silent, and common
sense would say "the initiator" is a single player. For CFJs, it was the
initiator of the CFJ, so it makes sense to read this as "the initiator of
the device."

To "initiate" is defined by Merriam-Webster as

1 *: *to cause or facilitate the beginning of *: *set going initiate a
program of reform enzymes that initiate fermentation
2 *: *to induct into membership by or as if by special rites
3 *: *to instruct in the rudiments or principles of something *(syn.
introduce)*

These definitions lead to at least three different reasonable possibilities
I can see:

The initiator of the device is the one who started it, or proposed it. (The
"special rites" of proposing the device fit nicely here.)

The initiator is the one that instructs the device. (This could be the
device rule or the Mad Engineer, as both can instruct the device to perform
certain actions)

The initiator is the one that started the device up, or turned it on.

Of these, the first makes the most sense, as CFJs are similarly proposed,
but as statements to be judged rather than a rule change to be voted on.
The second is a bit of a reach considering the device isn't a person, so
saying it is instructed or introduced to something doesn't make much sense.
The third would be a potential contender if the rule said "the initiators",
but as there is only one initiator, it makes more sense to go with the
single player that proposed the device to start it off, G., who is not
ais523, meaning ais523 is eligible.

This same line of reasoning could also be applied to the proposal itself
that enacted that rule that created the device. This would be a very
reasonable alternative, except that the context here is "all active players
except the initiator," and the proposal and rule are not active players. It
is common sense to assume the initiator is a potentially active player in
this context. And we do have such options to consider, so we did.

The (if any) part for the person barred is easier, as no parts of the
device rules seem to bar anyone. (Although Jason was barred in the same
message as the attempted assignments, but that's irrelevant since e wasn't
being assigned.)


Judge secretsnail's Evidence:

Rule 2654/32 (Power=1)
The Device

      When the device is on:
        * click - hummmmmmm
        * The week that contains the beginning of Agora's Device,
          together with the following week, is a Holiday.
        * A Device CAN activate or deactivate emself by announcement.
        * A Device change is any effect that falls into the above
          classes.
        * When a Device wins an election, e is installed into the
          associated office and the election ends.
        * As this Device is the highest honour that Agora may bestow, a
          Bearer of this Device OUGHT to be treated right good forever.
        * Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have a
          secured untracked Device switch with possible values ordinary
          (the default) and democratic.

      When the device is off:
        * whirrrrrr - THUNK
        * By default, a device CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, enact, amend,
          or repeal a regulation for which e is the Promulgator.
        * Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
          by the Agoran Device that e can no longer abide to be a part
          of it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly
          labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
          expressing eir reproach for those who e feels have treated em
          so badly.
        * When e does so, e fulfills any obligations with regards to
          that device.
        * Text purportedly about previous instances of the device (e.g.
          a report's date of last device) is excluded from the device.
        * If a Device has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
          judge that Device CAN assign it to emself without 3 objections.
        * Then, the Device changes, following which each active player
          gains 1 card of each type and eir grant (if any).
        * The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which
          e feels may be helpful in the use of the Device in the FLR.
        * A player CAN once a month grant eir Ministry Focus' Device to
          a specified player by announcement.
        * At any given time, each instance of a Device has exactly one
          possible value for that type of Device.
        * Any player CAN grant a Welcome Device to any player if the
          grantee has neither received one since e last registered nor
          in the last 30 days.
        * When the rules call for an Agoran Device to be made, the
          Device-making process takes place in the following three
          stages, each described elsewhere:

          1. Initiation of the Device.

          2. Voting of the people.

          3. Resolution of the Device.
        * When a Rule specifies that a random Device be made, then the
          Device shall be made using whatever probability distribution
          among the possible outcomes the Rule specifies, defaulting to
          a uniform probability distribution.
