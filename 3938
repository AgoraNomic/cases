Judge Jason's Arguments:

Per Rule 1689/6:

>       Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
>       combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
>       to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
>       four-week period.

First, I find that Agora is ossified if there are 0 players. If there
are 0 players, the set of "reasonable combinations of actions by
players" is 0, since the empty set can perform no actions, and therefore
there are no combinations of actions that can be performed (and
certainly none that can cause arbitrary rule changes). This does not
imply that, but for this provision, Agora would be forever locked if it
reached 0 players. A non-player could register and then perform actions,
but AIAN does not consider that possibility when determining if Agora is
ossified.

Next, let's consider the case of a single player who is not grok. The
following is a set of actions performable by a single player that result
in arbitrary rule changes under the current rules:

1. Ratify without objection that "grok is a player." Grok has registered
multiple times, and eir most recent registration was ended by
deregistration for inactivity. E has therefore consented to be bound by
the rules and has not revoked that consent, so e CAN be bound by the
rules under Rule 869/48; this is consistent with CFJ3455, which found
that statements suggesting lack of intention to be a player prohibit
registration by ratification, but grok has made no such statements. A
previous version of this judgement used Hillary Rodham Clinton as the
second person, but she has never consented to the rules and thus cannot
be registered by ratification under CFJ3583.

2. Ratify without objection that "There exists a proposal in the
Proposal Pool with id 99998, AI 1, author grok, title 'Do Nothing', no
coauthors, democratic class, and empty text."

3. Publish the following message: "I hereby resolve the Agoran decision
on whether to adopt Proposal 99998. It has no voters, and outcome FAILED
QUORUM." This will self-ratify such a decision into existence (and that
it was resolved) under Rule 2034/12, thus setting quorum to its minimum
of 2.

4. Wait 7 days for self-ratification.

5. Ratify without objection that "There exists a proposal in the
Proposal Pool with id 99999, AI 3, author grok, title 'Do Everything',
no coauthors, democratic class, and text [whatever is necessary]."

6. Publish the following message: "I hereby resolve the Agoran decision
on whether to adopt Proposal 99999. It has two voters (me and grok) both
voting FOR, and outcome ADOPTED." This will self-ratify such a decision
into existence, that it was resolved, and that the proposal took effect
under Rule 2034/12. This is consistent with the rules because quorum was
previously set to 2.

7. Wait 7 days for self-ratification.

This procedure would take less than 4 weeks and is reasonable for a
single non-grok player to perform. Thus Agora is not ossified if there
is a single player, and there is no lower number of players where Agora
would not be ossified. TRUE.


Evidence:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1698/6 (Power=4)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
      to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
      four-week period.

      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
      it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
      any other single change or inseparable group of changes to the
      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 869/48 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any entity (including a group of confederated entities) that is or
      ever was able to willingly communicate original ideas is a person.
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are
      persons.

      Questions about personhood are to be resolved equitably, with
      regard for the good-faith of those involved and the customs of
      honorable play.

      Citizenship is a secured person switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. A registered
      person is a Player. To "register" someone is to flip that person's
      Citizenship switch from Unregistered to Registered.

      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
      intends to become a player at that time. No person can be a player
      if e is part of another player or another player is part of em.

      A player, acting as emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player)
      by announcement. If e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered
      for 30 days.

      A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
      CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
      that person's willful consent.

      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
      or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
      unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2034/12 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation that

      1. such a decision existed,

      2. it had the number of voters indicated,

      3. it was resolved as indicated, and

      4. (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
         proposal existed, was adopted, and, if it had not
         previously taken effect, took effect.
