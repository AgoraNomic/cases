Caller's Arguments:

Given the original context of discussing recent mistakes, I
also thought coppro was being intentionally ambiguous, which arguably
means e /was/ being ambiguous (even if it was accidental).  Oh, and
trivially FALSE if coppro isn't Admiral of the Navy for some reason.

Judge G.'s Arguments:

On one hand, we don't want to discard actions for trivial typos.  On
the other hand, we should allow players to be able to claim an altered
after the fact, or allow players to disguise certain public actions as
others (e.g. AGAINT) - public should generally mean publicly transparent.
What tests should we use on this?

In no particular order:

1.  Intent.  Did the actor, at time of posting, have intent to claim a
deception based on the typo?  In the example of AGAINT, there was an
intent to create a deliberate error for deception.  In this case, I take
the actor's word, and the fact that e was surprised that no one had
followed up on the coup, as evidence that eir intent was straightforward
(nonwithstanding things like keyboard distance: things like auto-correct
make that sort of proof hard to support).  Intent is not the most
important test, as it only arises after ambiguity is raised, but it is
worthy of consideration.

2.  Rules Meaning.  Does the typo have its own meaning in the rules?  In
the case of AGAINT, there were two potential rules-based meanings (AGAINST
versus the private AGAINT=FOR deal).  In this case, "shilling" has not
only no rules meaning, but no particular synonym for a rules meaning,
especially in context of the palace.

3.  Importance.  Do the rules place very specific extra requirements for
clarity on this particular type of action (e.g. requiring "clear
specification" etc.).  Not in this case.

3.  Common meaning.  Does the typo have its own meaning outside of the
rules, in common parlance?  "Shilling", in fact, does.  As a noun for a
coin the sentence is nonsense, but as a verb it has a meaning in terms of
a deliberate deception.  This could easily indicate that the actor was
trying to make a rather obscure joke with the intent of it being non-
effective.  Additionally, the context of the whole message (talking about
correcting other errors) might support the joke idea. Several players
clearly interpreted it this way.

So, this action attempt passes the first three tests (the ambiguity was
not intended, nor did it create an obvious ambiguity between two rules-
based actions, nor does the action in question require extra certainty).
It's meaning in common parlance is semi-nonsense, but not complete
nonsense - sufficient enough that some other players, including relevant
officers, thought it was intentional nonsense.  Should this accidental
meaning be sufficient to invalidate the attempt?

This is very, very much an edge case.  But in this judge's opinion, if we
judge this to have failed, we are in fact, in this judge's opinion, acting
against the best interests of the game.  It would in fact make it easier
for players to introduce ambiguity through future AGAINT-type scams ("hey,
that failed because I made a typo!")  Rather, I think it is better to accept
actions that generally say what they mean, in order to limit ambiguity
as to what game actions are actually performed.  This would force would-be
scammers to be more ambiguous than this (e.g. "obviously" ambiguous) in
order for their actions to be claimed to fail.

Therefore I judge TRUE.  Semi-ironically, this likely means that "shilling"
will enter Agoran vocabulary in a similar manner to AGAINT, thereby making
it ambiguous enough to fail in future actions due to this clarifying
judgement.
