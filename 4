Call for Judgement from Karl Anderson: (Sun Aug  1 21:01:50 GMT 1993)

"The passage of Proposal 326 into Rule 326 was an illegal act
under Rule 316."

I find this statement to be FALSE

			 --------------------

Rule 316 has no governance in situations such as this, where the
course of the game (and hence the applicability of various rules) is
observable by at least one player. By rule 103, I am a player, and I
am therefore in a position to enforce and check the application of the
rules relevant to the passage of proposals into rules.
