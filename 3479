Judge's Arguments:

I'm inclined to agree that “formatting errors” is not an objective
criteria. Additionally, even if it weren't too ambiguous, it seems like
it would set a bad precedent to allow such difficult to determine
conditionals. It's a lot easier just to have people just resubmit the
proposal if a (formatting) error is found.

======================================================================

Judge's Evidence:

Since the context is lacking in the CFJ itself, I have included it below.

Publius Scribonius Scholasticus called the CFJ:
> Agora's To-Do List is a proposal that was in the proposal pool and has
> been pended.

This was caused by objections raised by Aris about the validity of the
conditional clause of the submission:
> "Formatting errors" is highly ambiguous. Unless you can clarify it
> down to something easily checkable, I'm going to count that statement
> as void.

The relevant text of PSS's submission is duplicated below:
> I submit the following proposal if it has no formatting errors and its
> passage would create two new rules:
