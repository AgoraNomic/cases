========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

Minor mistakes in reports deserve to be pointed out and
punished, in order to hold our officers to account, but minor errors
deserve minor punishments. CFJ 3205 is quite unambiguous that the error
occured (G. is not listed as inactive there, and the activity of each
player is part of the Registrar's report, and G. became inactive on Mar
20 and not active again until Mar 28; and the caller really should have
linked me to the appropriate messages or quoted them to save me spending
five minutes or so looking it up), but there's an interesting legal
point in CFJ 3206. The thing is, the number of inactive players is not
defined as part of the Registrar's report! However, there is some
unfortunate phrasing in rule 2143:

      While performing weekly or monthly duties or publishing weekly
      or monthly reports, officers SHALL NOT publish information that
      is inaccurate or misleading.

Note that this does not require the inaccurate or misleading information
to be part of the report; merely published at the same time. (This is
probably unintended.) Thus, the inaccurate inactive player count is
indeed a violation of rule 2143, but one so minor that I don't feel it
justified to give a nonzero penalty.

Thus, I judge:
CFJ 3206: GUILTY/DISCHARGE
CFJ 3205: GUILTY/APOLOGY {rogue, hack, crawl, tome, jade, powder}

Gratuitous Arguments by FKA441344:

So. My first formal Apology. I suppose I'm something of a rogue now,
although clerical errors aren't exactly the first thing that word
brings to mind. It makes me think of the characters in those
hack-and-slash dungeon crawl games, dodging traps and searching for
magic tomes, jade statuettes, and enchanted powders. But this is far
from relevant. The Rules indicate that my apology should explain my
error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire for self-improvement. I have
published incorrect reports; this is my error. I am ashamed to make
such mistakes. I feel remorse for the confusion I have caused. And I
desire self-improvement. I desire self-improvement both in general and
in specific. In general I desire to be fitter, smarter, more rational,
more knowledgeable, to have more useful skills, to be more confident,
more organized, less error-prone, and better in many other ways. In
specific, I wish to make less of the kind of error for which I am now
apologizing. I wish to become a better citizen of Agora, both in terms
of fulfilling my obligations and in serving the best interests of the
Nomic of Agora.
Ad maiorem Agora gloriam,
