Caller's Arguments:

The occasion for this CFJ is my attempt, acting as GWotO, to forgive
OscarMeyr's Oligarchy Upkeep debt for July (see <1>). But the question
is a general one, hence the general form of the Statement.

To show the truth of the Statment, I have to prove two things:

(1) The Treasuror is empowered to forgive debts to the Bank denominated
    in Bank Currencies.
(2) No other Player is so empowered.

The Rules define only one way in which a debt may be forgiven. R1596(d)
states that:

      (d) A debt is forgiven when the creditor of a debt sends a
          notice to the debtor that e is forgiving the debt.

When the creditor is the Bank, we must bear in mind R1478(e):

      (e) Only persons may perform actions. Non-persons perform
          actions only via the agency of persons, as specified by the
          Rules.

The Treasuror, as Executor of the Bank, is the only person empowered by
the Rules to act in a general way on behalf of the Bank. The various
Limited Executors of the Bank are empowered only to satisfy debts, not
to forgive them (see R1470(b)). This shows that (2) is true.

That (1) is also true is shown by R1470(e), which provides specifically
for the case of forgiveness of debts owed to the Bank:

      (e) The Bank is permitted to forgive debts owed to it, in whole
          or in part:
          (1) pursuant to a properly-issued Order; or
          (2) Without Objection, at the Treasuror's discretion.

Judge root's Arguments:

The caller's arguments that the Treasuror is the only Player empowered to
forgive debts to the Bank denominated in Bank Currencies are persuasive,
and I agree with them, having no arguments of my own to add to or detract
from them.

However, the statement of the CFJ does not refer exclusively to Players,
and since debts are Nomic Properties by Rule 1011, Rule 594 allows them
to be changed (or forgiven) by the application of an adopted proposal.
Thus, adopted proposals are also empowered to forgive debts to the Bank
denominated in Bank Currencies, so the statement is FALSE.

========================================================================

Judge root's Evidence:

Rule 1011/4 (Power=2)
Definition of Nomic Property

      A Nomic Property is any property of any entity the value of
      which is defined by the Rules.  Other Rules may define
      procedures by which the value of a Nomic Property may be
      changed.


Rule 594/6 (Power=3)
Power and Proposals

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.  Except as
      described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power of another
      entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing the Power to be
      so set.  No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power
      greater than its own.

      When a Proposal takes effect, its Power shall be set equal to
      its Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of
      the Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by
      the Rules.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

      Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable are
      ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision, each
      provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.
