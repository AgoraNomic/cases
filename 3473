Judge's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 3473 as TRUE.  

Thankfully this judgment doesn't change the world in any appreciable
way, as all of the relevant reports have been ratified.

Also note: There are many more gratuitous arguments from o that are
relevant, but Grammatical rules take precedence when using english
words, and that is where

The rule, at the time stated:
>   At the start of each month, if Agora's Balance is not 0 or less,

There are two interpretations here, and it boils down to what the
word `plus` means.

If the word plus implies addition, then I agree with o's
interpretation, and the Secretary would only only be allowed to pay
the exact total of 10 + officer salary:

BUT if the word is used as a conjunction then the rule gave the
secretary 2 seperate duties:
1 - Pay each player 10 shinies.
2 - Pay each player 10 shinies for each office that player holds.

Given the wording of the rule at the time, specifically the comma
before the word plus, I am left to interpret the word `plus` as a
synonym for the word `and` as the comma only makes sense if the word
plus is a conjunction.

It's left as an exercise for the reader to determine if any of the
grouped payments (Player + Officer Salary) made around this time were
valid, though it's of this judges opinion that grouping the payments
likely would've been valid as well.
