Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1989 (Power of Only 1) states that:
      (d) Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, each Player is eir
          own Prime Executor.
This, with the rest of 1989, is an explicit permission for a Player to
perform all actions allowed to Prime Executors, in other words, to act as
eir own prime executor.  According to Eris's judgement in CFJ 1413, such
explicit permission is sufficient for Rule 1016 (Power-2) to forbid such
acting to non-Frozen players.  Therefore, according to Rule 1016, acting
as one's one Prime Executor is forbidden to Frozen Players, as Rule 1989
specifically allows non-Frozen players to do so.

Note that this causes a self-contradiction in Rule 1016.  Rule 1016 allows
Frozen Players to deregister but forbids them from acting as their own
Prime Executor, but only by acting as eir own Prime Executor may a Frozen
Player deregister emself.

Note, finally, that Rule 1989(a) denotes prime-executorship as those
*required* to perform actions not *allowed* to perform actions, there may
be some room for maneuver in this difference.  A stronger counterargument
is that Rule 1989 regulates an AUTOMATIC STATE OF BEING for Players,
rather than Actions for Players, thus Rule 1016 would tie the hands of
Frozen Players without preventing them from being Prime Executors.

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1016/13 (Power=2):
Activity Levels

      Each player has an activity level, which is always exactly one
      of active, inactive, and frozen.  A player's activity level may
      not be modified except by methods described explicitly in the
      rules.

      This rule takes precedence over each rule that regulates
      activity levels and the powers or duties that a player may have
      because of eir activity level.

      An activity level of active is higher than any other activity
      level.  An activity level of inactive is higher than an activity
      level of frozen.

      Whenever a player registers or reregisters, e becomes active.

      A player may lower eir activity level by announcing that e does
      so and indicating eir new activity level, unless the rules do
      not permit that player to change to that activity level.  If the
      player becomes inactive in this way, e may not become active
      until at least 96 hours after e last become inactive.

      An inactive player may become active by announcing that e does
      so, unless the rules do not permit that player to become active.

      A frozen player who has been frozen for at least 90 days may
      increase eir activity level by announcing that e does so and
      indicating eir new activity level, unless the rules do not
      permit that player to change to that activity level.

      "Off hold" and "on hold" are unambiguous synonyms for "active"
      and "inactive", respectively.  "put in cold storage" is an
      unambiguous synonym for "frozen".

      Only an active player may vote, make proposals, hold office, or
      be a Judge of a CFJ.  An inactive player may not be required by
      the rules to perform any duty or action unless the rules
      explicitly state that they can require inactive players to
      perform that duty or action.  A frozen player may not be
      required by the rules to perform any duty or action, and is not
      permitted to perform any of the actions defined by the Rules
      that non-frozen Players are explicitly permitted by the Rules to
      perform, with the exception of changing eir activity level, and
      deregistering.

========================================================================

Judge Michael's Arguments:

At the time the CFJ was called, Rule 1016 said:

      A frozen player may not be required by the rules to perform any
      duty or action, and is not permitted to perform any of the
      actions defined by the Rules that non-frozen Players are
      explicitly permitted by the Rules to perform, with the exception
      of changing eir activity level, and deregistering.

When one writes that "X is the Prime Executor of Y" without specifying
which actions this is with respect to, then Rule 1989(c) tells us that
this is to mean that "X is the Prime Executor of Y" with respect to
all actions that the entity is required to perform.

Frozen Players can not be required to perform any actions, so the
quantification in Rule 1989(c) is over an empty set.  Rule 1989(d)
says that a Player is their own Prime Executor, and this provision
doesn't contradict 1989(c) or 1016.

I believe The Caller clouds the issue here with talk of "permission",
but is in line with my thinking in putting Prime Executorship as "an
automatic state of being".  In other words, Rule 1989 is a
definitional rule.  The phrase "acting as one's [own] Prime Executor"
is close to meaningless: either you are your own Prime Executor or
not.
