Judgement: FALSE

Reaons and arguments:

R1006/6 says that "An Office is a position of authority or
responsibility established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is
called an Officer."

This effectively defines two terms, both "Office" and "Officer".  So,
when R1458/3 says that "there shall exist an Officer called the
Notary", R1006's precedence must simultaneously require the existence
of an Office for the Officer to fill.

Equivalently, I believe it a consequence of 1006 that one can not be
an Officer without holding an Office.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1006/6 says, in part:

      A position of responsibility or authority is only an Office if
      the Rules specifically designate it as such.  An Office only
      exists as long as there is a Rule in force which specifies that
      it exists.  If the Rule or Rules which mandated the existence of
      an Office are changed such that they no longer do so, that
      Office ceases to exist.

Rule 1458/3 says, in part:

      There shall exist an Officer called the Notary.  The Notary
      shall generally be responsible for maintaining a Record of
      Organizations and the Players under the Jurisdiction of their
      SLCs.

Notice that 1458 does not explicitly specify that the Office of Notary
exists. It simply says that there is an Officer who is called the Notary.
Which Officer this is is not apparent. Therefore, by 1006, the Office does
not exist at all.

Notice that all other Offices are explicitly specified to exist, as, for
example, in Rule 910/5:

      Let there exist the Office of the Justiciar, with the duty to
      Judge various matters of law when the Rules so require.

Evidence:
---------

Rule 1458/3 (MI=1)
The Notary

      There shall exist an Officer called the Notary.  The Notary
      shall generally be responsible for maintaining a Record of
      Organizations and the Players under the Jurisdiction of their
      SLCs.

      The Notary shall maintain an up-to-date record of the following;

        i) The Name of every Organization.
       ii) The Administrator of every Organization.
      iii) The Executor of every Organization.
       iv) The Maintainer of every Organization's SLC.
        v) The Players within the Jurisdiction of every Organization's
           SLC.

Rule 1006/6 (MI=1)
Defaults for Officers

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.

      At any time, an Office is held by exactly one Player; if no
      other Rule directly or indirectly specifies which Player holds
      an Office, it shall be held by the Speaker.

      A position of responsibility or authority is only an Office if
      the Rules specifically designate it as such.  An Office only
      exists as long as there is a Rule in force which specifies that
      it exists.  If the Rule or Rules which mandated the existence of
      an Office are changed such that they no longer do so, that
      Office ceases to exist.

      A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
      privileges that the Rules assign to it.
