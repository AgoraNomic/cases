==============================  CFJ 1572  ==============================

    The phrase "no Votes were cast AGAINST it" in rule 2095 should be
    interpreted as "any vote cast AGAINST it either was cancelled or at
    the end of the voting period had a vote value besides AGAINST".

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 683 is silent on whether when a player changes eir vote from
AGAINST to ABSTAIN, it becomes the case that e cast eir vote ABSTAIN
and ceases to be true that e cast eir vote AGAINST.  However, rule 955
presupposes that changed votes work in exactly this way.  It is thus
in the best interests of the game that rule 2095 be interpreted as
specified in the statement.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

1.  Rule 2095/2 (as amended by proposal 4787)

2.  Rule 683/11

3.  Rule 955/8

1.

Rule 2095/2 (Power=1)
The Assessor's Boon Duties

      * If a Proposal passes, and that Proposal was submitted by a
        Player within that Player's Grace Period, then the Assessor
        shall award the Proposor the Boon of Prodigy, unless the
        Proposor has already received five or more such awards.

      * If an Democratic Proposal passes, and no Votes were cast
        AGAINST it, then the Assessor shall award the Proposor the
        Boon of Zeitgeist.

      * If a proposal submitted on Guy Fawkes Day is adopted then the
        Assessor shall award the proposer the boon of a penny.

2.

Rule 683/11 (Power=1)
Voting on Proposals

      A Voter authorised to cast votes on a particular Proposal may do
      so only by informing the Assessor of the vote or votes e is
      casting on that Proposal. A Voter may change or cancel eir vote
      or votes during the Voting Period by informing the Assessor.

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

3.

Rule 955/8 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      (a) When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
          uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be
          counted by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned
          a Voting Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no
          votes against, and at least one vote for, the Voting Index
          shall be Unanimity; if there are no votes for, the Voting
          Index shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index
          shall be the number of votes for divided by the number of
          votes against.

      (b) If the Voting Index is greater than one, and greater than or
          equal to the Adoption Index for the Proposal, and if Quorum
          for the Proposal is achieved, then that Proposal is adopted.
          Otherwise, it fails.

      (c) A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except as
          described in this Rule.  A Proposal cannot be adopted except
          as described in this Rule.

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

I accept the Caller's Arguments and judge TRUE.  However, I plan to
propose legislative clarification of the issues implied by this CFJ.
