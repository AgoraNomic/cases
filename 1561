Caller's Arguments:

The Library is not a person and only person can bear Patent Titles.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 2075, Rule 649 and Rule 2089 (Gardner Library).

========================================================================

Judge G.'s Arguments:

Agoran law contains no explicit definition of personhood, and a single, clean
common definition is hard to come by (eg.,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person).  While we may debate the metaphysics of
personhood for a while, a clear Agoran precedent on persons is needed in the
mean time.

Unfortunately, there are two contradictory definitions for personhood, natural
and legal.  The natural definition can be paraphrased as a "conscious thinking
human-being like entity", and leaving Turing Tests aside, it is reasonable to
accept the personhood of those who take it upon themselves to register as
players of Agora.  The library, as a construct of Agoran law, does not
reasonably meet tests of being a natural person.

But many legal definitions extend personhood to legal constructs, some quite
broad; e.g., a person is "An individual, limited liability company,
association, partnership, political subdivision, government agency,
municipality, industry, public or private corporation, or any other entity
whatsoever."
(http://www.ci.elko.nv.us/codes/City_Municipal_Code/Title_9/2/2.html)

However, whenever this latter legal definition appears, it is inevitably as
part of a specific definition contained in a specific contract or body of law.
Therefore, I find that any use of the non-natural definition for person is an
explicit legislative matter particular to any given body of law, and since
Agoran law does not explicitly define constructed entities to be persons, they
are not.  The Library is not a person by current Agoran law.

H. Petitioner Sherlock makes a further claim, that while non-persons may not
bear patent titles, they may "receive" one, as it is not prohibited.  However,
I quote the first sentence of R649:
      "A Patent Title is a legal item of recognition of a person's
      distinction."

I find that this sentence is not a minor appendage of this rule, as suggested
elsewhere.  Instead, it is a fundamental and legal definition: a Patent Title
IS legal recognition of a PERSON'S distinction.  As the Library is not a
person, it may not receive such recognition: to "receive" legal recognition is
to have it legally noted, in other words, to be awarded the title and to bear
it.  For a library to receive a patent title would not be a matter of
permission, but rather a matter of contradiction with the specific, legal
definition of Patent Title.

I judge TRUE, the Library can not receive boons and/or patent titles.

========================================================================

Judge G.'s Evidence:

H. Sherlock's gratuitous arguments:

>
> H. Clerk of the Courts,
>
> I would like to submit the following accompanying argument if it is
possible:
>
> To quote the relevant portion of R649,
>
>   When a Patent Title is awarded to a person, that person
>   is said to Bear that Patent Title; the Patent Title is Borne
>   by the person, and the person is its Bearor.  When a Patent
>   Title is revoked from a person, that person ceases to Bear
>   that Patent Title.  The status of Bearing a Patent Title can
>   only be changed as explicitly set out in the Rules.  Only
>   persons may Bear Patent Titles.
>
> The first line of the above text describes what happens when a Player
receives a title: e bears it.  So, it may be true that the Library cannot bear
a Patent Title, but there is no indiciation that it can't receive one. The
rules don't say what happens in that instance, but nowhere do they prohibit it
from occurring.
