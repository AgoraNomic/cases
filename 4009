Caller's Arguments:

R2124/31 does not directly ENABLE a player to object to an intent. It
instead ENABLEs a person to "act on eir own behalf, by announcement, to
[...] become an objector" to an intent. Becoming an objector to an
intent is a regulated action, as the rules describe the circumstances
under which it would fail (e.g. if the objector has previously
objected). It therefore requires an explicit method, which does not
appear to be provided. This may suggest that the underlying becoming
cannot be performed.

Notably, R2466 only specifically defines acting on behalf when the agent
and principle are different persons. However, that definition does
require the principal to be authorized to perform the underlying act and
that the method of the underlying act be used. It also makes acting on
behalf a regulated action, thus requiring an explicit method.

Based on the phrasing of R2124, it appears to authorize at most one of
"acting on one's own behalf" and "becoming an objector", while both of
which likely need an explicit method.

Notably, tabling an intent does not suffer from this same potential
problem, as it uses the "acting as emself" phrasing to restrict acting
on behalf. This would result in intents being able to be tabled but not
supported/objected to.


As a counter argument to the above, H. Judge Gaelan found in CFJ 3901
[0] that:

> 2466/2 only gives the phrase "acting on behalf"
> any special meaning when it's on behalf of another person, so "acting on
> one's own behalf" doesn't really have any special meaning or significance.
> By a plain-English reading, acting on one's behalf to do something is just
> doing the thing. So I think this works just fine.

However, the context is slightly different, the rule in question in that
case said that the principal does act on behalf of the agent (who
happens to be emself), rather than providing a method via CAN. I would
also ask the judge to consider this question in full, since CFJ 3901 did
not explicitly consider whether acting on one's own behalf might be
regulated.

Rule 1728/46 (Power=3)
Tabled Actions

      An action is a Tabled Action if the Rules purport to authorize its
      performance via one of the following methods:
      * With N Support, where N is a positive integer.
      * Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer.
      * With N Agoran Consent, where N is a positive integer multiple of
        0.1.
      * With T notice, where T is a time period.

      The parameters N and T, if omitted, default to 1 and 4 days,
      respectively (e.g. "without objection" means N=1). If a rule
      defines N as less than 1, it is instead treated as 1.

      A person, acting as emself, CAN by announcement table an intent
      (syn.  "intend") to perform a tabled action, clearly,
      conspicuously, explicitly, and without obfuscation specifying the
      action, the method (including non-default parameter values), and,
      optionally, conditions.

      A person is the sponsor of such an intent if e tabled it, or if e
      is authorized to perform its action due to holding a rule-defined
      position previously held by the person who tabled it.


Rule 2124/31 (Power=3)
Performing Tabled Actions

      For a given tabled intent, a player CAN, unless otherwise
      forbidden by the rules or the document enabling the action, act on
      eir own behalf, by announcement, to:
      * Become a supporter ("support" it), unless e tabled or previously
        supported it;
      * Become an objector ("object to" it), unless e previously
        objected to it;
      * Cease to be a supporter or objector ("withdraw" support/objection).

      An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the
      Speaker hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, and its
      conditions, if any, are each clearly and unambiguously met.

      An intent is mature if it was tabled at least 4 days ago and
      nobody withdrew objections from it in the past 24 hours.

      A rule purporting to allow a person to perform a tabled action
      allows em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents
      for that action/method combination:
      * With N Support: e is a sponsor or supporter of a ripe intent with
        at least N supporters.
      * Without N Objections: e is a sponsor of a mature ripe intent with
        less than N objectors.
      * With N Agoran Consent: e is a sponsor or supporter of a mature
        ripe intent with supporters greater than N times its objectors
        (e SHOULD list supporters and objectors).
      * With T notice: e is the sponsor of a ripe intent created at
        least T ago.


Rule 2466/2 (Power=3)
Acting on Behalf

      When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of
      another (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN
      perform the action if it is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so,
      taking into account any prerequisites for the action. If the
      enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which the agent
      may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same
      manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional
      requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
      action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the
      action is being taken on behalf of that person.

      A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so
      causes the second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act
      on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
      action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
      person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
      might be taken within a message, including actions that would
      otherwise be taken by publishing certain text.

      When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
      action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed
      by the principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is
      treated differently for some purpose, in which case it is treated
      as described by that rule.

      Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at
      power 2.0. This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      prohibit a person from taking an action, except that it defers to
      any rule that imposes limitations specifically on actions taken on
      behalf of another person.


Rule 2125/13 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances
      under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action
      would, as part of its effect, modify information for which some
      player is required to be a recordkeepor.

      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules SHALL NOT be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

In addition to Judge Gaelan's arguments in CFJ 3901,  CFJ 2077, CFJ
2292, and 2633 all found that, based on common English usage (not
specific rules text) that "acting on behalf of oneself" is the same as
merely "acting".  Which would mean it's not as protective as we think
(i.e. it wouldn't block Y from "acting on X's behalf to perform
something on behalf of emself" if there was a suitable contract to
that effect) but it's basically the same as "a player CAN act to do
X".

With several cases saying the same thing, it's to-date been a fairly
consistent reading based on common language, not specific rules-text
(albeit with the current rules clearly showing a legislative intent to
give the term a different context).

Gratuitous Arguments by ais523:

 I (perhaps naively) thought that the only sensible
interpretation of "acting on eir own behalf" was as a synonym for
"acting as emself" (used five times in the rules at present), which in
turn was a synonym for "in a message e sent, not in a message for which
someone else was acting on eir behalf". As such, I'm a little surprised
that CFJs have found differently. (That said, neither of these
correspondences seems to be explicitly defined in the rules at the
moment.)

Of course, my immediate interpretations of what the text should mean
probably don't have much rules force (*especially* when it comes to
literal-meaning-of-the-rules scams!), but may have some impact on a
rule 217 tiebreak.

I request that the judge of this CFJ, if e finds that "acting on behalf
of oneself" doesn't have the intended effect, also opines on whether
"acting as emself" does what it intuitively seems to do or whether it
does something else.


Reply to ais523 from G:

There's some history here - at the time of those earlier CFJs, I don't
think "acting on eir own behalf" was actually in the rules anywhere.
Rather, those CFJs were based on rules text that said "Player X CAN
act on behalf of Player Y" and asked whether that text worked if
circumstances led to X=Y.  In the current ruleset, the more explicit
appearance of "acting on eir own behalf" is clearly *intended* to be a
synonym for/interchangeable with "acts as emself", so it's partially a
question of whether that context shift changes the CFJ readings that
were opined before that explicit rules text was enacted?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

I agree that "acting on eir own behalf" and "acting as emself" are
both equivalent to simply "acting", and are thus generally unregulated;
only specific forms of acting (e.g. voting) are regulated. "Acting on
someone else's behalf" is regulated, but that doesn't mean that the
superset "acting on someone's behalf" is regulated; again, only specific
forms of acting on someone's behalf (i.e. when the someone is not the
same person as the actor) are regulated.

In addition, whatever "acting on one's own behalf" means, Rule 2124
itself authorizes both "acting on one's own behalf" and "becoming an
objector" (or equivalently "acting on one's own behalf to become an
objector"), specifying the explicit method of "by announcement". Caller
claims that "by announcement" appears to authorize at most one part, but
gives no convincing reason why we should interpret the rule that way,
when it was pretty clearly intended to work the other way.

Thus the intent was successfully objected to, and thus the attempted
declaration of Apathy was ineffective. I judge FALSE.
