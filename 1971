    includes the disclaimer in the evidence section.

Caller's Evidence:

The disclaimer below, and also the fact that this CFJ came into
existence in the first place.

--
DISCLAIMER: Any opinions in the above message may not be shared by my
employer (if I in fact have an employer), and possibly not even shared
by me. Any statements in the above message are not necessarily true,
even if the message makes them appear to be so, although any game
actions I take in the above message still have an effect. I may or
may not believe that this sort of disclaimer is a blatant attempt to
try to get round rule 2149, and may or may not care that this sig is
far too long to normally be accepted on Usenet. This disclaimer also
applies to the disclaimer itself, in that nothing in it is or should
be construed as a claim by me that it is necessarily true for the
purposes of rule 2149, although that does not prevent any claims in
it (or the message above, for that matter) to be true. The above
message and this disclaimer claim to have been written by ais523 (who,
like ehird, has 100 points), and this entire sentence is a claim as
to the identity of the message's poster. I do not warrant that
attempting to use any scams in the above message or the associated
disclaimer may or may not be useful for you or get you into Agoran
legal jeopardy, and do not make any claim either way as to whether
doing so violates copyright or patent law (or trademark law, for that
matter). This signature was not checked by a lawyer. Who reads these
things anyway?

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

It may be possible, but only if taking the "attemped game action" in
question does not depend on the truth value of the statement, the
truth of any information contained within the statement, or the
truth of contextual information required to make the statement work.
In particular, it doesn't work if the action requires reporting or
announcing any kind of information (vote results, point scores, claim
denials, etc.), as the DISCLAIMER ensures that said "reporting" contains
no information whatsoever on the truth of the information it purports
to report, and so doesn't actually report it.

========================================================================

Judge BobTHJ's Arguments:

In agreement with the gratuitous arguments by Goethe, I judge
TRUE....the possibility exists.
