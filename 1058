Decision & Reasoning Judge: 

In the matter of CFJ 1058, I find the Statement to be FALSE. 

There is yet considerable doubt in my mind as to the proper number of
Infractions which should have been imposed against Morendil for his recent
flagrant abuse of judicial power.  However, the penalty imposed by an Infraction
is binding whether or not imposed properly, and it is clear that Andre, as Clerk
of the Courts, did impose sufficient penalties to give Morendil in excess of 30
Blots.  Whether Andre did so properly need not be addressed in the instant
matter; propriety is simply not an issue.  To the best of my understanding,
Morendil did indeed have at least 31 Blots at the time of elJefe's allegation,
and thus elJefe's allegation is correct, and no Crime was committed.

Judgement of FALSE is entered.
