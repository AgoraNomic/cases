======================================================================

Barred: 
We would like to Bar any Player who was declared (whether successfully or 
not) as part of the Triumvirate during the Mousetrap Scam.  (Note that 
Rule 869/2 makes this a valid method to identify a Player, as it is 
unambiguous; we're just not sure who those three Players were...) 

======================================================================

Arguments:
A Compact cannot require any actions of someone outside it's Jurisdiction. 
Therefore, since any prospective Player is by definition outside the
Compact's Jurisdiction, the Compact cannot cause (or coerce) that Player
to be included within it's Jurisdiction. 

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I judge TRUE.

I take this to be a statement about general principles, rather than
restricted to the particular Classes of Organizations currently defined.
(In the latter case, it might very well be that all the Classes have
highly restricted methods of expansion. I will not go further into that.)
The caller's arguments are consistent with this.

Wes's arguments are somewhat, but not fatally faulty. He notes "A Compact
cannot require any actions of someone outside it's Jurisdiction." I do not
find that this alone is enough for his conclusion to hold. 

Specifically, I do not believe that the (forced) inclusion of a Player 
into a jurisdiction counts as an action by that Player.

However, I find that it does count as a requirement, and so Rule 1530
still applies. 

Yours logically,
Oerjan.

Evidence:
  Rule 1529 (excerpt)
  Rule 1530 (excerpt)

"Statutes: ... must be obeyed by Players within the Compact's
Jurisdiction..." [Rule 1529/0]

"A Compact has no force to require, or oblige, anything of Players who
are not within its Jurisdiction... This Rule takes precedence over any
other Rule governing Compacts." [Rule 1530/0]
