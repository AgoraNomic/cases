Caller's Arguments:

Right now, I send a message to a public forum explicitly stating that
I do not deregister. I CFJ on the previous statement. So, I see no
such public message, but precedent is that this works anyway, though
it has to use the equivalent phrasing "I act on behalf of myself to
deregister". I submit this paragraph as arguments.

Judge G.'s Arguments:

While the statement is not strictly *semantically* true, Agoran
communications standards generally accept the *legal* truth, that
announcing[1] "I hereby announce that I do X" is the same as announcing
"I do X" (CFJ 2077).  In fact, in order to allow sequential powers-of-
attorney (which are permitted AFAIK), we have to allow that, given
appropriate empowering contracts, "I announce that Goethe announces that
Warrigal announces that Murphy announces that the AFO announces that the
AFO does X" has the same/similar results as the AFO announcing "I do X".
Therefore, any reasonably finite nesting of "I announce that I say that
I send a message that I say that I announce that I do X" is legally
reducible[2] to an announcement of "I do X", provided (a) that such
nesting does not create ambiguity, paradox, etc., which the statement
in question doesn't[3], and (b) that the message as a whole was in actual
fact sent to a public forum and so constituted an announcement, which
the statement in question was.  I judge TRUE.

[1] R478: "send a message to a public forum" is the same as
    "announcing".
[2] Legally reducible for determining what sort of announcement is
    made, but not for all purposes.  For example, as a CFJ statement,
    the semantic distinction between a CFJ on "Right now I send...that
    I do X" and a CFJ on the statement "I do X" is enough to infer a
    legal distinction[4] in the judgement[5].
[3] "Right now" is taken as applying to the legal time of the message
    without contradiction or confusion.
[4] The former being is a question on the nature of the announcement,
    not the nature of the action, while the latter may have been a more
    interesting question might have been whether it is in fact possible
    to "not deregister" by announcement.
[5] Such as this one.
