Judge Walker's Arguments:

GUILTY is clear from the past few IADoP reports and a search of the
archives. (eg. http://www.mail-archive.com/search?a=1&l=agora-official%40agora
nomic.org&haswords=registrar&from=&notwords=&subject=&datewithin=1w&date=Mar+2
1+2011&order=relevance&search=Search
). All of R1504 a through e apply.

For sentencing, there is not much precedent on cases not involving the
use of SILENCE, which is obviously no longer available, so I will try
and work out what is a fair sentence. DISCHARGE is clearly not
appropriate and there is nothing to FINE so I am left to consider
judgements of COMMUNITY SERVICE or TIME OUT. Yally's pledge to
complete the work and then not doing so is a clear aggravating factor
and I would consider this to render a COMMUNITY SERVICE sentence to
complete the Registrar's report pointless as the ninny is unlikely to
complete the task. I can think of no other appropriate COMMUNITY
SERVICE tasks that could be used. Therefore I am left with TIME OUT,
and deem the minimum number of days appropriate for the severity of
Yally's crime.

I judge GUILTY / TIME OUT for 7 days.

========================================================================

Appellant Yally's Arguments:

I appeal this case[s question on sentencing, on the grounds that this
punishment is not only excessive, but also because sentencing TIME OUT could
very likely have a negative impact on players, thus destroying the long run
quality of the game if this is to be established as precedent.
