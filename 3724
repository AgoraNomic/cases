Caller's Arguments:

The judgements for at least one (and maybe all) of these CFJs should be
PARADOXICAL.

A few weeks back, ATMunn was indisputably Prime Minister and Gaelan
attempted to win by apathy. Gaelan’s attempted win would have been
successful except that without-objection intents were broken at that
time. Shortly thereafter, I published an intent to appoint Gaelan
specifically to be Speaker (it was not a general “appoint a speaker”
intent; I specifically said I intended to appoint Gaelan). Then I
attempted to execute that intent and deputise for Prime Minister to do
so. That deputisation would be EFFECTIVE if Gaelan had won by apathy and
had been laureled. As a result, if intents are fixed retroactively, then
Gaelan was retroactively laureled and my deputisation succeeded in
installing me as Prime Minister retroactively.

After I attempted that deputisation, I next acted on behalf of ATMunn to
attempt to distribute by Manifesto a proposal to fix dependent actions
retroactively. I believe a quorum attempted to vote FOR and no one
attempted to vote AGAINST.

Soooooo.... I think that the Assessor can’t resolve this proposal
without resulting in a PARADOX.

To put it another way:

[1] If dependent actions are NOT fixed retroactively, then ATMunn was
Prime Minister at the time of the below message and the attempted
distribution of Proposal 8164 was EFFECTIVE;

[2] If the distribution of Proposal 8164 was EFFECTIVE, then in a timely
fashion the Assessor CAN and MUST resolve it to be ADOPTED;

[3] If the Assessor resolves Proposal 8164 ADOPTED, then that
retroactively fixes dependent actions, thereby making me Prime Minister
retroactively at the time of the attempted distribution of Proposal 8164;

[4] If I was Prime Minister at the time of the attempted distribution of
Proposal 8164, then the attempted distribution by me-acting-as-ATMunn
was INEFFECTIVE, the proposal was never properly distributed, and
therefore the Assessor CANNOT and MUST NOT resolve it to be ADOPTED (and
a CoE to challenge a purported ADOPTION would be proper and would
prevent ratification);

[5] If Proposal 8164 is not ADOPTED, then dependent actions are NOT
fixed retroactively;

[6] Return to step 1 above and repeat.

Sorry all!

I think we can fix this by a proposal that
retroactively-retroactively-fixes the gamestate.  But in the meantime, I
think these CFJs are PARADOXICAL...?

Judge's Arguments:

This CFJ is the third of three that comprise an attempt by D. Margaux to
Win by Paradox, the other two being CFJ 3722 and CFJ 3723. This third CFJ
is extremely straightforward to resolve. Rule 955/26, "Determining the
Will of Agora", states that:

    The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
    cannot change thereafter.

No Agoran decision about whether to adopt Proposal 8164 has been resolved,
so although two have been initiated, neither of their outcomes can
possibly have been determined, whether ADOPTED or otherwise.

I judge CFJ 3724 FALSE.
