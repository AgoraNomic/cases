Judgement Distributed:                As of this message

=====================================================================

Caller's Arguments: 

This should be a direct consequence of Rules 1011 and 1770.

======================================================================

Evidence attached by the Caller: 

<none>

======================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

 " Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
   permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
   the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
   implicitly permit it.  "
Since the distribution of proposals are regulated by the Rules in 
Rule 1770, it is only permitted in the way that the Rules state.
