The part between "> I " and "e\\\\\" variously translates as
  1) Ã†ÃžEÂ®Ã°ÃŸÅ‹Ã¾ÅŠâ€™Ãž<ÃžÂºÅ‚Ä›Â©Ã¦Ä—Ã¦Å‚
  2) ÆÞE®ðßŋþŊ’Þ<Þºłě©æėæł
  3) 쎆쎞슮쎰쎟 [etc.]
none of which appear to mean anything coherent.

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

if it is clear what he did, then it must be
clear what he did; however, it is not clear what he did; therefore, it
is not clear what he did.
