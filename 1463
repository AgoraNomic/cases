========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

This is clearly a matter relevant to the game, unlike
the CFJs submitted last spring relating to things like the
identity of the capital of England.

========================================================================

Judicial Order(s) by OscarMeyr:

1.  I Order the Caller to provide eir best estimate of the total amount
e has spent on coffee, up through the time e posted eir CFJ.

2.  I Order the Caller to provide references sufficient for the Court to
investigate the current evidence in and status of the P = NP problem.

3.  I Order the Caller to submit a copy of eir blood donor card, as
evidence of eir blood type.

4.  I Order the Caller to submit eir preference about beer.

========================================================================

Judicial Order(s) by OscarMeyr:

To restore the game to a meaningful state, the Court Orders the Caller
to reestablish eir CFJ eligibility on terms that are logically
resolvable with reasonable effort.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

This CFJ rests upon the logical truth values of each and all of five
statements made by the Caller, in eir message requesting to be
ineligible for a certain type of CFJ (Trial Judge's Evidence 1).  These
statements are:

I. I have, as of the sending of this message, spent an odd
number of cents in my life on coffee.
II. There exists a problem solvable in nondeterministic
polynomial time but not in deterministic polynomial time.
III. My blood type is O negative.
IV. I like beer.
V. There are fewer people in the world with red hair at the time
I send this message than there were 24 hours before.

The Court shall evaluate these in order of ease of resolution.

Statement IV is easy to resolve; the Caller has stated eir preference, e
dislikes beer.  So St. IV is false.

Statement III is also easy to resolve.  The Caller has stated eir blood
type is A positive.  So St. III is false.

The remaining three statements are not so easy.  The Court notes that
all three statements can be resolved with perfect knowledge (as required
by R991).  The rub is that these statements are progressively difficult
to resolve with limited knowledge and resources, and in finite time.  A
reasonable effort to resolve these statements has not produced a
definite answer.

Statement I would be resolvable with knowledge of the Caller's total
lifetime coffee expenses.  The Caller readily admits to not knowing this
amount, only its general range.  The Court does not consider the effort
of tracing the Caller's lifetime coffee transactions, computing the
total spent, and determining whether tax and tips are relevant, as a
reasonable use of this game's time.  Therefore, St. I is deemed
logically indeterminate for practical purposes.

Statement V would be resolvable with an accurate census of the world's
population, broken down by hair color, taken at the time the Caller sent
eir message and 24 hours before that.  A modern country such as America
requires several weeks to conduct a census, which is taken only once
every ten years; two censuses taken 24 hours apart would be impractical
even with the resources of a major nation.  The Court has considered
that the general trend in the world's population is ever towards higher
numbers, and has allowed that this trend could be mapped to any
particular subset, such as a particular hair color.  However, such a
mapping cannot be considered definite without at least one set of
accurate data, and even so would still be subject to statistical
uncertainty.  Even though the Court sympathizes with the objective of
the League of the Red-headed Men (Duncan Ross, Secretary; 7 Pope's
Court, Fleet Street, London, UK) and its sponsor by bequest Ezekiah
Hopkins (late of Lancaster, PA, USA), the statistical uncertainty in
available population figures leads the Court to deem St. V as logically
indeterminate for practical purposes.

Statement II, the P = NP Problem, is the subject of intensive very high
level mathematical research.  The Court has reviewed some of the
material in this area; a detailed review promises to be the stuff of
doctorate courses in theoretical math.  Current science has not found a
solution to this Problem, either for or against it.  In fact, the
Court's review of the Problem suggests that the Problem itself might
even be in the NP class!  Perfect knowledge, gained in infinite time,
would permit a definite resolution of the Problem.  But this is
unavailable to the Court, who must rely on the best efforts of the
world's researchers.  And those best efforts indicate that the Problem
has not yet been solved, and it is unknown whether a solution even
exists.  Therefore, the Court deems St. II as logically indeterminate
for practical purposes.

So the truth values, in practical terms, resolve to:

I:  Indeterminate
II:  Indeterminate
III:  False
IV:  False
V:  Indeterminate

This CFJ's statement rests on the truth values of statements that the
Court considers indeterminate.  Therefore, a reasonable effort cannot
logically resolve this CFJ to either TRUE or FALSE.  Thus, under
R1565(ii) (Evidence 2), the Court DISMISSES this CFJ.

Judge OscarMeyr's Evidence:

1:  The Caller's message,
http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m10194.html:

Subject:            BUS: Being evil.
     Date:            Tue, 30 Sep 2003 14:20:12 -0400
     From:           Nathan Russell <nrussell@acsu.buffalo.edu>
 Reply-To:           agora-discussion@agoranomic.org
       To:            agora-business@agoranomic.org

Under the Rules, a player may request to be ineligible to judge
any CFJ or class of CFJs.

I request to become ineligible to judge the following class of
CFJs: CFJs made while an odd number of the following are true:

I. I have, as of the sending of this message, spent an odd
number of cents in my life on coffee.
II. There exists a problem solvable in nondeterministic
polynomial time but not in deterministic polynomial time.
III. My blood type is O negative.
IV. I like beer.
V. There are fewer people in the world with red hair at the time
I send this message than there were 24 hours before.

I CFJ on the following statement:

Pakaran is presently eligible to judge one or more CFJs.

ARGUMENTS: This is clearly a matter relevant to the game, unlike
the CFJs submitted last spring relating to things like the
identity of the capital of England.


2:  Rule 1565/10 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judgement of DISMISSED should be delivered if and only if one
      or more of the following is true:

        i) The CFJ does not contain a single clearly-identified
           Statement.

       ii) After a reasonable effort to obtain all relevant
           information, the Judge can neither determine the Statement
           to be true nor determine it to be false.

      iii) The Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.

       iv) The CFJ lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
