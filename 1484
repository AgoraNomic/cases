Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

1484:  TRUE.   Registrar OscarMeyr indicated that e was accepting
an informal COE, but did not state what report e was correcting, nor did

e publish a correction of the appropriate portions of the report.
Therefore, eir correction is invalid.  The Court issues a Claim of Error

on the Registrar's Report of 6 Feb 2004, that Kolja was incorrectly
listed as "Klaus" in the sections Summary, Recent Events, and Players;
also, Kolja was incorrectly listed as a Watcher in the same report.  The

Court reminds the Registrar that if e admits the COE, e must publish a
corrected version of the relevant portions of the report; a general
instruction to change the report is not sufficient.

Evidence 2:  R1431
Rule 1431/16 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Claim of Error is a public message claiming that a specific
      public communication misrepresents the actual Game State, and
      documenting the nature of the error.  The person who sent the
      original communication is hereafter known as the Journalist, and
      the portion of the communication claimed to be in error is
      hereafter known as the Yellow Document.

      A Response to a Claim of Error is a public message from the
      Journalist that either admits or denies the claim.  An admission
      is not valid until the Journalist posts a corrected version of
      the Yellow Document.

      If the Journalist was required by the Rules to publish the
      information in the Yellow Document, then e must publish a
      Response as soon as possible, unless one of the following holds:

        a) E has already published a correction.
        b) A previous Claim was made concerning the same error.
        c) The Claim was posted more than three weeks after the Yellow
           Document.
        d) The Claim is in dispute.  If the Claim ceases to be in
           dispute, then the Journalist must publish a Response as
           soon as possible after it ceases to be in dispute.

      If the Journalist was not required by the Rules to publish the
      information in the Yellow Document, then e is encouraged (but
      not required) to publish a Response in a timely fashion.

      A Player who incorrectly denies a Claim commits the Class 1
      Crime of Implausible Deniability.  However, if e admits the
      Claim within three days after the incorrect denial, then e shall
      not be convicted of this Crime.
