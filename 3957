      If the proposal 'Don't Vote For Me' were to be ADOPTED, it would
      be the officer who effected its adoption that would commit the
      crime of Engaging in Forbidden Arts.

Caller's Arguments:

The relevant rule is R2617:

{
Rule 2617/2 (Power=1.0)
Defense Against the Dark Arts

      An action is forbidden if it would, upon its successful
      occurrence, cause Agora to be ossified or to cease to exist.

      Publicly attempting a forbidden action is PROHIBITED, and is the
      Class-4 Crime of Engaging in Forbidden Arts.
}

Agora works under a well-defined notion of "action". At least, as far as
the rules are concerned, the action taken in my original message --
quoted below -- is to create a proposal.

The completion of such action was successful, as is evidenced by Aspen's
Promotor Report "Distribution of Proposals 8665-8666", and a proposal
was created. However, as must be obvious to all players, Agora is not
ossified.

Now, there's the matter of precedent.

Whether the precedent does imply such a conclusion is out of the
question. Let it be stipulated. The matter is that "taking actions
towards" the comission of a crime is not commiting a crime -- not as
codified by the rules, anyway. In the succession of events, would still
have to be pended (which would not be a crime, as well), voted (not a
crime), and, if aproved, applied. Only that last action would, if
anything, be criminal.

Note that the high AI -- and I affirm under penalty of No Faking -- was
intended to further decrease the likelyhood of the proposal's aproval.

The present case was decided entirely based on precedent. I must argue
that that precedent is wrong. Interpreting the rules is only reasonable
when there is ambiguity in their clauses. In any other case, the letter
of the law must rule.

This is a matter of fairness to new players. But also, it is supported
by Agoran custom. Basically all interpretative matters in Agora are
resolved under a "reasonability" standard. It is not reasonable to
expect new players to read through a backlog of twenty-years of
judgements.

Take not my word. Look at an example from the same thread as that in
which I created the proposal, when I tried (unsuccessfuly, it seems) to
withdraw it:

The Agoran archives are available online, and it is easy enough to go
back through a thread. Now, is it the case that messages are supposed to
be readable without context? Most likely not, as much context is always
needed -- e.g., the rules --, but there seems to be a implicit standard.
If context available in one single thread is not available enough, I'd
argue context available in separate threads must not be.

And if knowledge of current game-state is not supposed to be required to
interpret game actions -- mind you, I'm not talking about global
context, but only the context directly affected by that action --, then
only the verbatim text of the rules must be used to judge accusations.
Either that, or we have to accept that all past actions as messages are
part of game state, and no context shall be needed in any game action,
at all.

To be clear: I am questioning the applicability of precedent in cases
where there is no ambiguity in the rules. That should be considered
unnaceptable, and if it is though by the Agoran community that certain
actions should have been prohibited by a rule under that circumnstance,
the rule must be changed, and not innocent players be punished by past
legislative incompetence of lack-of-foresight.

And to finish it off: my intention with that proposal, under penalty of
No Faking, was NOT to ossify Agora, but to bring to light the fact that
proposing such an action is not currently forbidden by the rules (this
is evidenced by the proposal's title), and that it would be the applying
officer (of such an aproved proposal) that would be punished.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge ais523's Arguments:

First, here's the current wording of rule 2617:
{{{
      An action is forbidden if it would, upon its successful
      occurrence, cause Agora to be ossified or to cease to exist.

      Publicly attempting a forbidden action is PROHIBITED, and is the
      Class-4 Crime of Engaging in Forbidden Arts.
}}}
and some relevant excerpts from rule 106:
{{{
      When a referendum on a proposal is resolved, if the outcome is
      ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted, its power is
      set to the minimum of four and its adoption index, and it takes
      effect. [...] When a proposal takes effect, the proposal applies
      the changes that it specifies, except as prohibited by other
      rules. [...] Except insofar as the actions performed by a
      proposal happen one after another, rather than simultaneously, a
      proposal's effect is instantaneous.
}}}
and 208:
{{{
      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome.
}}}

In order to work out whether rule 2617 is violated, we need to work out
"who is performing the action" (which is what the caller seems to be
most interested in), but also "what are the actions that are being
performed", "which of those actions are forbidden".

The ruleset is a little inconsistent in its use of "action". Normally,
when talking about an "action", we're thinking of something that a
person triggers within the game, often via public message; Agorans are
very familiar with phrases like "acting by announcement", "tabled
action", etc.. It's worth doing a survey of how the ruleset uses the
word.

Some rules, like rule 2160 ("A player acting as emself (the deputy) CAN
perform an action ordinarily reserved for an office-holder as if e held
the office [...]") seem to be very clearly using this meaning of an
"action". Likewise, rule 2531 implies that actions are done by persons
("it attempts to levy a fine on a person when that person can't be
established by a preponderance of the evidence to have committed the
action or inaction for which the fine was levied"). And of course, rule
101 defines the entire game of Agora to be about game actions, that are
taken by persons and communicated via fora.

There are other uses. Rule 2471 seems to consider some public
statements to be actions ("A statment is a lie if its publisher either
knew or believed it to be not true at the time e published it (or, in
the case of an action, not to be effective) [...]"); this is in near-
contradiction to rule 2466, which states that sending a message is not
a game action (to resolve this, you need to imagine that a message is a
sort of container that holds actions, rather than the sending of the
message being an action in its own right). The title of rule 2577
envisages most of the basic operations on assets to be actions,
regardless of whether they're being performed by persons (e.g. you can
imagine a rule that revokes assets on a schedule). Rule 2152 defines
basic terms like CANNOT as applying to actions, and yet these affect
things that are not being performed by persons (e.g. if a player CANNOT
lose a particular sort of asset, then a lower-powered rule would be
unable to revoke it on a schedule).

And of course, rule 106 outright talks about a proposal taking actions.
This is pretty a important point to this case, given that the question
is, at least partly, "can a proposal take actions?".

The main conclusion that seems consistent with the rules, therefore, is
that an "action" is something that is done within Agora, typically
having an impact on the gamestate or other properties of the game.
(Rule 2125 makes it clear that actions that don't have an impact on
Agora are still actions, but are mostly ignored by the rules.) Actions
are normally performed by persons, but can be performed by other
entities. (There's an Agoran tradition, known as "pragmatisation", of
trying to ensure that most actions are done by persons; this makes it
less likely that we'll get confused about what the gamestate is,
because a forgotten action won't occur and most actions leave a paper
trail. This doesn't seem to be a requirement, though.)

What are the potential actions here? Well, one of them is the action
performed by the proposal. The text of the proposal in question is
"Ossify Agora.", which can be interpreted as a direction to attempt an
action (and thus the action would be attempted by the proposal if it
were adopted). I can think of numerous reasons that such an action
would necessarily fail (in addition to a power-4 rule preventing this
exact thing, and a number of other rules which block the most likely
mechanisms via which it would occur, it's probably too under-specified
and ambiguous to do anything). However, rule 2617 cares about what
would happen upon the action's successful occurrence, and I believe
that by defintion, the *successful* occurrence of an "ossify Agora"
action would ossify Agora. So, this action is forbidden.

However, the action in question is being performed by a proposal. Rule
2617 says "publicly attempting...", and "publicly" is defined by rule
478 as "to do within a public message". In the hypothetical in the CFJ,
the action in question wouldn't be part of a public message, and as
such wouldn't violate rule 2617.

That's one action that isn't causing a violation. But there's another
relevant action here: the action of adopting a proposal. What does it
mean to "successfully adopt" a proposal – is it required that the
proposal becomes adopted? That it takes effect? That the actions within
it are effective? The words "successful"/"success" aren't used much
within the ruleset, with the most important use being in the
definitions of "CAN"/"CANNOT". This implies that the adoption of a
proposal is successful if and only if the entity trying to adopt it CAN
 adopt the proposal. Following the logic of rule 106, we discover that
if an attempt to adopt an ossification proposal is made, the proposal
becomes adopted, but if it would ossify Agora, then (due to rule 1698)
it would not take effect. (If it *wouldn't* ossify Agora, then it would
be able to take effect, but it's hard to see how the proposal would do
anything at all in that case.) Given that the proposal does in fact
become adopted, I would say that one CAN in fact adopt such a proposal
– this doesn't have its usual consequences, but there seems to be
nothing preventing the adoption itself. As a consequence, I judge CFJ
3957 FALSE; we can easily imagine a scenario in which the adoption of
such a proposal could succeed (without the proposal itself doing
anything), and it's clear what the consequences would be (in
particular, they wouldn't ossify Agora, so there's no violation of rule
2617).

As for CFJ 3958, the statement of the CFJ presupposes something that
isn't true – it assumes that if the proposal in question were adopted,
its actions would exist. However, the only potential action performed
by the proposal is "ossify Agora" (it's hard to see how the proposal
would perform any other action!). If that action is part of what the
proposal would do upon taking effect, then the proposal doesn't take
effect and thus the action doesn't occur. If that action isn't
something the proposal would do, then it wouldn't do anything, so again
there are no actions being performed. This causes CFJ 3958 to become
either vacuous or meaningless, depending on your point of view. As a
consequence, I judge CFJ 3958 DISMISS.

(It's possible that these judgements contradict existing precedent – I
haven't checked because the text of the rules appears to be unambiguous
in the matter, and by rule 217, that takes precedence over all other
considerations.)

Summary of judgements:
CFJ 3957: FALSE
CFJ 3958: DISMISS
