========================================================================

Panelist Murphy's Arguments:

I consider the interpretation of the caller and Judge OscarMeyr to be
reasonable.  It is not the only reasonable interpretation, but game
custom is to Judge SUSTAIN in such situations.  I hereby do so.

========================================================================

Panelist Maud's Arguments:

Terms can be interpreted in many ways, and rule 754 was written to
provide general guidelines for selecting interpretations.  In
particular, terms may only be interpreted in their ordinary-language
meaning if they have not been given a technical meaning by the rules, by
the mathematical community, or by the legal community.  The term "vote
upon" is defined by rule 683 as a sort of action performed by submitting
a particular sort of message to the Assessor.  Hence it was incorrect
for the judge of CFJ 1550 to base eir judgement on an ordinary-language
interpretation of "vote upon".

========================================================================

Panelist Manu's Arguments:

It is my opinion that "voted upon" means the action of voting on a
Proposal by a player. Therefore, I agree with OscarMeyr's judgement
that "votes made before the Proposal was aborted should be duly
recorded and reported" as they are valid votes. This is plain and
simple to me. My decision is SUSTAIN.
