[Arbitor's note:  A version of this CFJ was called, assigned and judged
using this ID# by ATMunn, then later it was determined that the initial CFJ
call failed.  This is a "re-call", assigned the same ID#].

Judge G.'s Arguments:

[Note for the record: these arguments were written by ATMunn, who was
the appropriate judge for this matter, as a matter of courtesy and
precedent, whenever possible I respect the judgement of "first judges"
on any matter until overturned.  If a motion to reconsider is filed,
I intend to give ATMunn the option to write a new opinion -the Arbitor] 

The Door CAN generally be Slammed on a player after a Black Card is
awarded to em, provided that eir most recent deregistration took
place with eir consent.

Rule in question (2507):
    A Black Card is a card appropriate for a person who plays the
    game, not currently a player, who either broke the rules while not
    a player or broke them while a player and then deregistered in bad
    faith. A Black Card CANNOT be issued to current players, and no
    more than 3 Black Cards CAN be issued per week. Any attempt to
    issue a Black Card in violation of these limitations is
    INEFFECTIVE.
        When a Black Card is issued, as a penalty, within the next 7 days,
    any player CAN once, with Agoran Consent, Slam the Door at the bad
    sport. After the Door is Slammed at a person, e CANNOT register or
    take any game actions for 30 days, rules to the contrary
    notwithstanding. Any attempt to Slam the Door on a player or a
    person whose most recent deregistration took place without eir
    consent is INEFFECTIVE, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

The rule in question here (see above) clearly states that the Door CAN
be slammed on a bad sport after e has had a Black Card issued to them.
The problem then is, can it also be slammed on a player, as long as eir
most recent deregistration took place with eir consent?

This rule strictly states that Black Cards CANNOT be issued to players.
Rule 2426 says that "It is inappropriate to award a card to a non-player
person unless the rule defining the card says otherwise." The Black
Cards rule certainly says otherwise, and "inappropriate" is not a
binding term. So, it is IMPOSSIBLE to issue a Black Card to a current
player.

So, this arises the question: What if a Black Card was issued to a
non-player person who then became a player? This is certainly possible,
as long as the Door was not Slammed on em when they were a non-player.

Now we must determine if the Door CAN be Slammed on a player, if that
player managed to get a Black Card as a non-player and then registered
within the last 7 days. Rule 2507 says that "any attempt to Slam the
Door at a *player* or a person whose most recent deregistration took
place without eir consent is INEFFECTIVE." The answer is right here.
The rule specifically says a player or a person, so the Door CAN be
Slammed on players. And, if it is IMPOSSIBLE to Slam the Door on
someone if eir most recent deregistration took place without eir
consent, then the reverse is true as well, and it is POSSIBLE to Slam
the Door on a person whose most recent deregistration took place with
eir consent.

I judge CFJ 3607 TRUE.
