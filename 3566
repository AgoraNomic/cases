I’ll have to do my best.

voting was not extended, voting ended at Mon, 18 Sep 2017 01:19:41 UTC, 
exactly 7d after distribution (rule 107, “Initiating Agoran Decisions").

(“Resolving Agoran Decisions”) states:

announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to be initiated, 
then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after the end of the voting

“Common Definitions”), e did not do so in a timely fashion, and has 
violated the above clause of rule 208.

which are fundamental to Agora. However, I believe a Yellow Card would be 
inappropriate, and unduly punitive. Instead, I note that nichdel delayed 
assessment for reasons e spelled out in a message to agora-discussion:

Judge Publius Scribonius Scholasticus' Arguments:

(initial judgement)
I find CFJ 3566 TRUE. The issued card was not appropriate because no 
action was taken. Due to its inappropriateness, it was ILLEGAL as a
violation of Rule 2426. However, I believe given the nature of the 
lateness of the report, a serious card was warranted and I recommend that 
it be issued. I would also like to specify that the Caller's Argument that 
his argument is supported by game custom should not be taken into account 
in future card issuances because card issuances are not bound by game 
custom.

(judgement upon reconsideration)
In reconsideration of the judgment, I judge CFJ 3566 FALSE. The pink slip 
was INEFFECTIVE, therefore it could not have been ILLEGAL.
