Caller's Arguments:

I argue FALSE:  the R1728 definition of intend w/o objection as being
the first part of an action attempt (and not an action in itself)
overrules the posting of intent as a registration action in R869.

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

I may have posted intent to register,
but I didn't intend to register.

========================================================================

Judge omd's Arguments:

I personally believe that the message contained a clear statement that
e intended to register, but as the issue sort of concerns me I'm not
going to opine on it.  Eir message did not clearly indicate that e
intended to become a player-- it's fairly common to post intent to do
something without actually planning to do it, though I think doing so
is technically lying-- so e did not successfully register.  FALSE.
