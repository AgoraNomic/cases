Judge ais523's Arguments:

FALSE[3391], TRUE[3392] respectively. 

Being capable of communicating in English via
email does not necessarily mean that a person owns an email address;
they might, for instance, have to borrow one off someone else. I've seen
several instances in which multiple people have shared an account
elsewhere, and with clear signatures, there is no real problem with this
arrangement.

The message very clearly claims to have been sent using Walker's
address, but by Sam. Regardless of whether this is true or not, it has
correctly been claimed. In general, looking at the address from which an
email claims to have been sent is a good way to determine who claims to
have sent it; the presumption, in the absence of other evidence, is that
players do not allow other players access to their email addresses.
However, the presumption can be overridden given enough context in the
message itself or the surrounding circumstances; and that's what
happened here.

In general, if an email address were shown to generally be used by
multiple persons, rather than one in particular, or one person by
default except when the message body clearly indicated otherwise, it
would fail to be indicative of anything, and messages would lack a claim
of identity if there were no explicit claim of identity added to the
message. This doesn't mean, incidentally, that those hypothetical
messages would have no author; it just means that a) the claim of
authorship does not self-ratify (due to not existing); and b) it may be
hard to determine who the actual author of the message was. (But this is
true in any case where the existence of a person is uncertain.)
