==============================  CFJ 1250  ==============================

    Rule 1664 should be interpreted that the effects which are applied
    specifically to Abiding Players or specifically to Rebellious
    Players upon the success or failure of a Call for Revolt, are
    applied based on a Player's status as Abiding or Rebellious at the
    time the Registrar determines whether the Call for Revolt was
    successful or not, and not at the time the Call for Revolt is made.

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1664/13 (Power=2)
Rebellion

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
      always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch from
      Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding if e has not
      does so during the current month by sending a message to the
      Public Forum saying e does change so. The Registrar shall
      include in the Registrar's Report a list of all Players that are
      Rebellious.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that
            week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the Public
      Forum.

      The Registar shall select a random integer from 1 to the number
      of Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held) at the time of the Call
      for Revolt.  If this number is less than or equal to the number
      of Rebellious Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held by a
      Rebellious Player), then the Revolt succeeds; otherwise it
      fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in
      order):

         - The Registrar shall expunge all Blots of each Rebellious
           Player.
         - The Registrar shall pay out 40 Stems to each Rebellious
           Player.
         - All positions in the Oligarchy become vacant.
         - All Abiding Players that hold one or more Offices in the
           normal fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and
           hold them temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again
         - The Herald is empowered and required to levy a tax of
           75% on indulgences. The holder of the Patent Title
           "Robespierre" is exempt from this tax, even if other rules
           don't allow tax exemptions.
         - A Speaker Transition occurs

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall notify the Herald of all Blots that have
      been gained or expunged as a result of this Rule.

Judge Crito's Arguments:

Whenever the Rules call for some action to be taken depending on some aspect
of the gamestate, unless otherwise specified, we have no other choice than
to assume that this must refer to the gamestate at the time the action is
taken.

Although the Rule in question refers to the number of Players at the time of
the call for Revolt, it does not make any similar reference of timing with
respect to Players' Rebellious status.  I find no justification within the
wording of the Rule to extend this assumption of timing beyond selection of
the random number.  Since there are no other specifications as to timing, it
must be
assumed that actions which depend upon a Player's Rebellious status refer to
the status of the Player at the time the action is to be taken.  Therefore,
I find this statement to be TRUE.
