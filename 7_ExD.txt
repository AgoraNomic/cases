Rule 991/31 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
      syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into by
      announcement.
      
      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN optionally bar
      one person from the case by announcement.
      
      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement.
      
      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.
      
      Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
      person or "unassigned" (default).  To "assign" a CFJ to a person
      is to flip that CFJ's judge to that person.  To "remove" or
      "recuse" a person from a being the judge of a CFJ is to flip that
      CFJ's judge from that person to unassigned.
      
      When a CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion. The players eligible to be assigned as judge
      are all active players except the initiator and the person barred
      (if any). The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all
      interested players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.
      If a CFJ has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge
      that CFJ CAN assign it to emself without 3 objections.
      
      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
      case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
      judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.

Annotations:
CFJ 1692-1693 (called 20 Jun 2007): A CFJ can be unambiguously
   referenced by using the customarily-assigned sequence numbers, even
   if the number was not assigned in the public forum, provided that
   those involved accept it as unambiguous at the time.
CFJ 1355 (called 28 Apr 2002): Titles for CFJs are unregulated, so it is
   possible for a title to be assigned to a CFJ informally.
CFJ 3623 (called 09 Feb 2018): CFJing on a future hypothetical without
   specifying relevant assumptions is indeterminate.
CFJ 3805 (called 31 Jan 2020): Maintaining CFJ archives is hard.
