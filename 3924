Caller's Evidence:

> I simultaneously plan to flip my focus to Legacy and plan to flip my focus
> to Compliance.


Caller's Arguments: 

Rule 478/39 reads in part:
                             Any action performed by sending a message is
        performed at the time date-stamped on that message. Actions in
        messages (including sub-messages) are performed in the order they
        appear in the message, unless otherwise specified.

The "unless otherwise specified" seems like a bit of a security hole,
given that several mechanisms in the rules would break if people could
perform multiple actions simultaneously.  But I can't find a prohibition
against that - the "in the order they appear" is written not as a limit,
but as a default that can be overridden - can it go so far to specify "at
exactly the same moment (simultaneous)"?

Rule 2638/0[extract]
       An active player CAN Plan to Flip eir own Ministry Focus,
       specifying any valid value for eir Ministry Focus, by
       announcement. At the beginning of a month, every active player's
       Ministry Focus is set to the value e mostly recently specified by
       Planning to Flip. If a player did not Plan to Flip eir Ministry
       Focus switch in the last month, it is not flipped.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Cuddlebeam's arguments (prior to motion):

Your attempt to simultaneously Flip, failed; because: CFJ 2086 (called 15
Jul 2008): Message-based actions are always taken in some order, never
precisely simultaneously, possibly unless otherwise stated.

I Judge FALSE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gratuitous arguments by ais523:

CFJ 2086 found that game custom was that, if there are no other cues
about timing within the message, multiple actions taken in the same
message happen in the order in which they are written; and that the
rules are silent on the issue, so game custom is used as a rule 217
tiebreak. (It didn't mention the other rule 217 tests, but I think
those also point towards an "actions happen in sequence unless
otherwise stated" viewpoint; in addition to being game custom, this is
clearly in the best interests of the game, and is also supported by
common sense.)

In this case, though, there are other cues about timing in the message
(it explicitly states it's trying to do two things simultaneously), so
the precedent of CFJ 2086 doesn't apply (both because it explicitly
stated it doesn't apply in this case, and because the reasoning that it
used doesn't hold up in the situation where the message outright says
otherwise).


Gratuitous arguments by G.:

In addition to ais523's arguments, Rule 478/23 (in effect at the time of
CFJ 2086), didn't contain the "unless otherwise stated" sentence.  That
legislatively-inserted text (by P6785, adopted August 2011) is a key point
in the caller's arguments for the current cfj. That text makes CFJ 2086
out-of-date since the rule is no longer silent and the text of the rule
now applies. Evidence:

       A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent
       to all players and containing a clear designation of intent to
       be public.  A person "publishes" or "announces" something by
       sending a public message.

Judge Cuddlebeam's arguments (following motion):

I Judge FALSE.

Backed by the arguments provided, I have become convinced that it is
possible to try to simultaneously flip a Switch. However, doing so would
attempt to make it an indeterminate value, and by R2126, such attempts
would instead cause the switch to take on its last determinate and possible
value if any, or its default otherwise.

Since it would instead take on its last determinate value, there ain't no
flippin' flipping, because attempting to flip an instance of a switch to a
value it already has does not flip the switch (R2126).
