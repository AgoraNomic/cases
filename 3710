Caller's Arguments:

As argument, I present this quote from rule 1728:

      1. A person (the initiator) conspicuously and without obfuscation
         announced intent to perform the action, unambiguously and
         clearly specifying the action and method(s) (including the
         value of N and/or T for each method), at most fourteen days
         earlier.

      2. If the action is to be performed Without N Objections, With N
         Agoran Consent, or With Notice, if the intent was announced at
         least 4 days earlier

I satisfied requirement 1 just now, and requirement 2 in the quoted 
message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Aris's Arguments [first judgment]:

About half an hour ago, Gaelan attempted to win by exploiting a perceived
loophole in Rule 1728. I will now quote the relevant portion of that rule,
from the section stating the requirements for a dependent action.

  1. A person (the initiator) conspicuously and without obfuscation
     announced intent to perform the action, unambiguously and
     clearly specifying the action and method(s) (including the
     value of N and/or T for each method), at most fourteen days
     earlier.

  2. If the action is to be performed Without N Objections, With N
     Agoran Consent, or With Notice, if the intent was announced at
     least 4 days earlier

Gaelan tried to win by Apathy, using one buried intent to satisfy R1728(2)
and then another open intent to satisfy R1728(1). This relies on the 
assumption that the R1728(1) and R1728(2) intents can be separate from each
other. However, this is not the case. While R1728(1) specifies merely (and 
somewhat ungrammatically) that the initiator must have "announced intent",
R1728(2) discusses requirements for "the intent". The use of the definite
article in R1728(2) means that the intent used to satisfy it must be the
same one previously mentioned, i.e. the same one used to satisfy
R1728(1). Thus, Gaelan cannot use one intent to satisfy R1728(1) and a
different intent to satisfy R1728(2).

I would like to congratulate Gaelan on finding the bug in Rule 2465,
"Victory by Apathy", that means the same intent can be used infinitely
many times. However, as the theory underlying the victory is faulty, I
rule both these cases FALSE.


Judge Aris's Evidence:

Rule 2465/0 (Power=0.3)
Victory by Apathy

  A player CAN Declare Apathy without objection, specifying a set of
  players. Upon doing so, the specified players win the game.


Rule 1728/40 (Power=3)
Dependent Actions

  A rule which purports to allow a person (the performer) to perform
  an action by a set of one or more of the following methods (N is 1
  unless otherwise specified):

  1. Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no greater
     than 8. ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this method with
     N = 1.)

  2. With N Support, where N is a positive integer. ("With
     Support" is shorthand for this method with N = 1.)

  3. With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
     with a minimum of 1.

  4. With Notice.

  5. With T Notice, where T is a time period.

  thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all of
  the following are true:

  1. A person (the initiator) conspicuously and without obfuscation
     announced intent to perform the action, unambiguously and
     clearly specifying the action and method(s) (including the
     value of N and/or T for each method), at most fourteen days
     earlier.

  2. If the action is to be performed Without N Objections, With N
     Agoran Consent, or With Notice, if the intent was announced at
     least 4 days earlier

  3. If the action is to be performed With T Notice, if the intent
     was announced at least T earlier.

  4. At least one of the following is true:

     1. The performer is the initiator.

     2. The initiator was authorized to perform the action due to
        holding a rule-defined position now held by the performer.

     3. The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
        action depends on support, the performer has supported the
        intent, and the rule authorizing the performance does not
        explicitly prohibit supporters from performing it.

  5. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
     other rules.

  6. If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was
     given in the announcement of intent to perform the action, all
     those conditions are met.

  Such an action is known as a dependent action. The actor SHOULD
  publish a list of supporters if the action depends on support, and
  a list of objectors if it depends on objections.


Judge Aris's Arguments [following motion to reconsider]:

On motion to reconsider, I judge both noted CFJs TRUE. I still think
my prior interpretation is correct (and would prefer it be part of any
fix), but it seems like the interests of justice and R217 require me
to go with the more literal interpretation in this case, given
Gaelan's reliance upon it and the text of the rules explicitly taking
precedence over game custom and common sense. So, to be clear, I still
think I was right before, but am judging these TRUE anyway because I
think I should.
