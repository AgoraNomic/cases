Caller's Arguments:

[ais523's arguments]

zooping isn't really defined in this context, but most
Agorans have a basic idea of what it's meant to mean. Given that I could
just create a CFJ by announcement, what happens here?

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

[ais523's action]

I zoop a CFJ on the statement "This is a CFJ."

[Murphy's action]

If this failed to initiate a CFJ, then I initiate a CFJ on the
statement "This is a CFJ."
