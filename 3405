Caller's Evidence

Caller's Arguments:

AFAIK, the first part is true, as scshunt is currently ahead on
points, with 2 proposal points plus 20 office points.

The second part is also true; according to the Herald's report,
scshunt has won 13 times as of February, more often than any other
person.

Therefore, the announcement is true, so per Rule 2419, scshunt now
wins the game again.

CFJ 2450 may or may not prove me wrong about this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge G.'s Arguments:

The Rule in question reads:
      If any player has a score of at least 250, then any player who
      has at least as much score as any other player can make an
      announcement naming all players with the highest score and
      indicating that they have won Agora.

      Upon such an announcement, if it is true, then all such players
      win the game and a new game begins.

First, I'm going to read 'can' as 'CAN', as we are guided to do, and
there's no argument for not doing so.

I'm also going to accept that, at the time of announcement, as per the
Caller's arguments, scshunt was the set of all the players that had the
'highest score and have won Agora'.  So the facts omd announced were
true. Nice loophole, that.

In the past, at times, we have used named announcements.  For example,
"A player with authority X posts a Notice of Victory by announcing
that player Y wins."  If a player posts Y and Z, but lacks authority X,
e has posted a set of true facts, but it's not an official Notice of
Victory. 

I find that "such an" announcement clause effectively names or
encapsulates the announcement, such that if it is not made with the an
appropriate preconditions, it is not "such an" announcement.

This seems, at first blush, to directly contradict CFJ 2450, which
visited a very similar situation, down to the "such an" phrase. And,
from the gratuitous arguments, this was a controversial point that was
eventually decided the other way.

The key to my finding is the CAN.  The CAN strongly implies that
"such an" announcement CANNOT be made in any other way.  Now, of
course the facts can be announced by anyone, but this limitation stops
arbitrary announcements of fact from being treated as "such an"
announcement in its effects: it is IMPOSSIBLE to make "such an"
announcement except as the preconditions allow.

In CFJ 2450, the rules involved a MAY instead of a CAN.  This
is a different implication.  With a MAY, the implied opposite (MAY NOT)
implies that a posting of the facts by an unauthorized person is still
a POSSIBLE (but ILLEGAL) way to make "such an" announcement.   

FALSE.
