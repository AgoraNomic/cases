      If the definition of quanging a player had not been explicitly
      included in the message in evidence, the attempt to transfer
      currencies on behalf of Tenhigitsune would have failed.

Caller's Arguments:

Using "quang" without explicitly citing the definition would leave out the
"act on behalf" part.  From the judgement of CFJ 3663:
https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/2018-September/039201.html

"Therefore, for ANY zombie action, the zombie's name must appear explicitly
in the action message, AND a clear indication that it's an act-on-behalf
action (via verbs like "I act on behalf" or "I make" or "I cause" or "I
have" or explicitly indicating that the explicitly-named person is the
agent's zombie).  And importantly, "in the message" means NO substitutions
allowed."

Judge D. Margaux's Arguments:

I judge this TRUE, adopting the callerâ€™s arguements. As the caller
notes, this outcome does seem compelled by CFJ 3663.
