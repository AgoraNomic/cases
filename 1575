Caller's Arguments:

CFJ 1278, once closed, is now open, due to the existence of an
outstanding judicial motion [R1868p1].  R1827(last paragraph) reads:
      If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original
      Judge of that case is not active or is not a player, then a new
      Judge shall be assigned to the case as usual.

Judge root was so assigned, but what are root's responsibilities?
One possibility is that root is merely required to grant or deny
the outstanding motion, which would lead to there being no outstanding
motion, and an existing judgement (Syllepsis's judgement) and therefore
the case being closed again [R1868p1].

HOWEVER, by Rule 408, EACH judge assigned to a CFJ is required to
judge within a certain time limit, and by Rule 591, this must be a legal
judgement.  Both R408 and R591 have higher precedence than R1868.
Furthermore, R1827 states that root's assignment should be treated
"as usual" and therefore there is no reason to believe that the requirement to
judge is waived.  Therefore, by R408 and R591, judge root is required to
return a valid judgement for CFJ 1278.

The question of whether Judge Syllepsis' or Judge root's judgement
would have precedence is left until an actual judgement has been delivered by
root.

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1868/3 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      A CFJ is open if it has not been Judged, or if an outstanding
      judicial motion pertaining to it has been neither granted nor
      denied.  A CFJ is closed if it is not open.

      As soon as possible after becoming aware that an open CFJ has no
      Judge assigned to it, the Clerk of the Courts shall choose a
      Player eligible to Judge it, and announce them as its Trial
      Judge.  That Player remains the Trial Judge of that CFJ until e
      is recused from it or becomes ineligible to Judge it.

Rule 1827/5 (Power=1)
Granting or Denying Motions

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
      for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
      sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
      Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
      Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Judge to
      perform as requested by the Motion.

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      shall note the determination made and the reasons, if any, on
      the record of the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the
      Motion of that determination.

      If a Judge fails to Grant or Deny a Motion within five days of
      when it was forwarded to em by the Clerk of the Courts, e
      commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of Slow Motion, which may be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts. If this occurs, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall Recuse the Judge and assign a new one as
      usual.

      If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original
      Judge of that case is not active or is not a player, then a new
      Judge shall be assigned to the case as usual.

Rule 408/17 (Power=1)
Late Judgement

      For each Judge assigned to a CFJ, eir Deliberation Period begins
      when the Clerk of the Courts announces eir assignment, and lasts
      seven days; eir Overtime Period begins when eir Deliberation
      Period ends, and lasts seven days.

      A Judge who Judges a CFJ during eir Overtime Period commits the
      Class 0.5 Infraction of Judging a Bit Late, to be reported by
      the Clerk of the Courts.

      During a Judge's Overtime Period, if e has not yet Judged the
      CFJ, then the Clerk of the Courts may recuse em by announcement.

      Upon the end of a Judge's Overtime Period, if e has not yet
      Judged the CFJ, then the Clerk of the Courts shall recuse em by
      announcement as soon as possible.

      A Judge recused according to this Rule commits the Infraction of
      Failure to Judge; the Class of this Infraction is Class 3 for an
      unlinked CFJ, or for a single incident of Linked CFJs, Class 2
      plus the number of Linked CFJs.  This Infraction is to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts. The recused Judge becomes
      ineligible to Judge any CFJ for one month, or until e publicly
      requests to become eligible again, whichever is sooner.

Rule 591/18 (Power=1)
Legal Judgements

      The Judge of a CFJ Judges it by submitting eir Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  "Decision", "Finding", and "Response" are
      unambiguous synonyms for "Judgement".

      For a Trial Judge, a Judgement is exactly one of the following:
      TRUE, FALSE, or DISMISSED.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Judgement, the Clerk of
      the Courts shall publish it, along with any arguments, evidence,
      or other material included with the Judgement.

Judge Taral's Arguments:

Looks broken to me, but broken it is. The caller's argument is sound
and I find no fault in it. I enter a judgement of TRUE.
