Rule 478/11 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      A Public Forum is a medium of communication so designated by
      the Registrar. Sending a message to a Public Forum shall be
      considered the equivalent of sending that message to all
      Players.

      A Discussion Forum is a medium of communication so designated
      by the Registrar. A Discussion Forum shall never be a Public
      Forum and messages sent to a Discussion Forum are never
      considered to have been sent to all Players.

      The Registrar may designate a given medium of communication to
      be (or cease to be) a Public Forum or a Discussion Forum Without
      Objection. An announcement of such a designation shall be made
      via the medium whose designation is being changed. Any
      designation of a medium as a Public Forum shall also be
      announced via all existing Public Fora in addition to any
      other requirements.

      It is the responsibility of every Active Player to ensure that
      e is able to receive messages via each and every Public Forum.
      Any inability of a Player to receive messages via a particular
      Public Forum does not deprive that medium of its legal status
      as a Public Forum. Players are in no way required to receive
      messages via any particular Discussion Forum.

      The Registrar shall include as part of eir Report all media
      which are currently Public or Discussion Fora and sufficient
      data regarding each medium to allow new Players to receive
      messages via that medium.

      Any communication which has been sent via a Public Forum shall
      be considered to have been made publicly. Any communication
      which has been sent to all Players via some other medium, or
      combination of mediums, shall be considered to have been made
      publicly, provided it contains some clear designation that it
      is intended to be public.

      If the Rules require a Player to publish certain information,
      then e is considered to have satisfied that requirement at the
      time e publicly sends a message containing the information e is
      required to publish.

      If the Rules require a Player to announce certain information,
      that announcement must be made publicly.
