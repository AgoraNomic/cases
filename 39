This appears not to have gone out the first time, so I am re-sending
it.

CFJ 39 has been submitted by Wes.  The Judge shall be:

[Comments from Clerk:  These are tricky.  I am not sure what should
 be done here, but I do urge Judges to take note of Rule 404 as well,
 as it seems to be relevant.]

I judge FALSE.

As I see it, the argument here depends on the definition of "in
the proper way."  Rule 106 clearly allows other rules to define
"the proper way" for proposing rule changes.  The question is,
does that limit other rules to regulating only the actions involved
in submitting the proposal, or can they regulate the form in
which proposals are submitted as well?  While my judgement is
admittedly a bit subjective, I would argue that the "way" in
which proposals are proposed includes the form.  As I see it,
the first part of rule 403 can be read as, "The proper way to
propose an amendment to a rule is to (i) explicitly state
which rule it amends, and (ii) fully state the amended form
of the rule."

I find rule 415 to be irrelevant, as nothing in it states or even
implies that other rules cannot impose other requirements that
must be satisfied in order to properly make a proposal.
