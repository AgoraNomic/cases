==============================  CFJ 2996  ==============================

    Under the ruleset proposed by P7015, the conditions under which a
    promise are not destroyed must also be conditions required to be
    true for the promise to be cashed.

Caller's Arguments:

"The conditions of the promise" refers everywhere else to
the conditions required for cashing, and in general the wording of the
clause about destruction does little to contradict this
interpretation.

Caller's Evidence:

Evidence:

>    Optionally, the author CAN, in the creating message, specify a
>    set of conditions required to be true for the promise to be
>    cashed.  The default is that the promise has no conditions.
>[...]
>    A Player CAN cash a promise in eir possession by announcing that
>    e does so, provided either that the promise has no conditions, or
>    all of the conditions of the promise are true.  To do so, e must
>    clearly and unambiguously identify the promise and SHOULD publish
>    its text.
>[...]
>    Cashing a promise destroys it, unless the conditions of the
>    promise explicitly and clearly include conditions under which the
>    promise is not so destroyed, and these conditions are true.

Judge ais523's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 2996 TRUE. A condition on destruction is still a condition.
