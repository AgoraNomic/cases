Caller's Arguments:

The rules do not specify whether a CFJ must have a subclass. I believe
that custom would, in general, suggest the more permissive
interpretation.
It may be impossible to initiate a subclassless (hereafter "vanilla")
CFJ, but that doesn't prevent one from existing (such as if it was
left over from before a hypothetical vanilla-initiation rule was
repealed).
Although a vanilla CFJ would have no judicial questions and never
require a judge, the closure of a CFJ does not cause it to cease to
exist, but simply frees the CotC from the obligation to report its
status. Thus, the existence of a vanilla CFJ would be stable (it would
not instantaneously self-destruct in a puff of unsmoke).
It seems, therefore, that there is no reason why a vanilla CFJ should
be unable to exist. I recommend a judgement of TRUE.

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

I accept the caller's arguments and judge TRUE.
