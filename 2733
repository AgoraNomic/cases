In that case, the first distribution, and thus the first ID
assignment, failed. The second ID assignment also failed due to a
wording mistake on my part. I wrote:

>This message serves to initiate, and assign an ID number to, the
>decision of whether to adopt the following proposal:

This would mean assigning an ID number to the decision, when it should
be the proposal having an ID.
However, a decision can be initiated without an ID number being
assigned. What is required is that I publish the proposal with the
clear intent of distributing it, which initiates a decision. This
decision is in turn only initiated if a person authorized to initiate
it posts a notice saying so. That notice must include all essential
parameters.

First question is: is the promotor authorized to post such a notice?
Game custom assumes e is, but the language is confusing. The decision
must be initiated by the posting of a notice, but it also platonically
is initiated by the distribution of the proposal. One not unreasonable
interpretation is that there is no person who is authorized to
initiate the decision. (This is further confused by the initiation
being called a "means" of removing the proposal from the pool
(=distributing it) which messes up cause and effect a little.
Distribution causes initiation and removal, but the initiation causes
the removal...) The other interpretation, the one game custom implies,
is that the distribution is the notice in question.

Second question: if the promotor can initiate decisions, did I at any
point succeed in doing so with P6546/8? The clear intent to distribute
was only present in the first try, which specified the wrong author.
The second try did publish it with a clear intent to initiate the
decision, but failed in any case to specify the valid options, so
nothing happened. The third try did publish the proposal (in a quote)
without clearly intending it to be distributed, so ID assignment 6548
failed too. I then went on to initiate the decision on proposal 6548,
which didn't exist, so in the end I probably haven't done anything.

The only possibility is if you read my third try as "I hereby initiate
the decision on whether to adopt [and at the same time I publish (it's
in the quote) and distribute] [the proposal I just referred to as]
proposal 6548", maybe even with an implicit ID assignment in there.

========================================================================

Judge G.'s Arguments:

R106/24 reads:
      A player specifically permitted by the Rules to distribute a
      Proposal CAN distribute the proposal by publishing it with the
      clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
      distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
      distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
      whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.

This clearly states that an authorized person publishing a proposal
with the clear intent of distributing it does in fact distribute it,
whether or not e publishes any other information (e.g. information
required by the R107 decision initiation process).  And it also clearly
and directly states that said distribution acts to initiate the Agoran
decision.  Moreover, it fails to authorize the promotor to initiate the
decision, as required by R107.  Rather, it states right out that the
distribution notice initiates the decision.

Now, R107/11 is actually divided into two parts. First, a method for
initiation (describing what an initiating notice must contain) which
ends with a sentence similar/parallel to that of R106, saying that "The
publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period for the
decision."

Here, in context, "initiating a decision" in R106 MUST be treated to
be the same as "initiating the voting period for a decision" in that
the voting period is the only thing that R106 says is "described
elsewhere" that can in fact be "initiated".  It's nonsensical to say
that a process (Distribution) initiates the publication of a further
notice!  This is where I disagree with the caller, who states that
initiating a decision somehow "initiates" a requirement for the
publication of a R107 Notice.

So there are actually two orthogonal methods of initiating [the voting
period for] a decision, by R106 distributing a proposal, or by publishing
a valid R107 notice of initiation.  The methods do not conflict in spite
of the fact that they require different levels of information (and if
they did conflict, the R106 method would have numerical precedence).

In the current case, the second attempt did not have full R107-notice
details (available options etc.), but it DID have R106 intent to
distribute, and the Promotor was authorized to do this by R1607/28, which
distributed the proposal.

TRUE.

I should note that this interpretation is the best of a set of poor
options.  It's not for the good of the game to weaken the information
needed to initiate decisions (and it may mean past distributions
which were thought to fail actually succeeded).  But note that the
alternate interpretation, that the distribution "initiates" the need
for a R107 notice, does indeed break the system as the caller describes,
as the promoter is not in fact authorized to publish said R107 Notice.
This interpretation runs against R1698/1 as it would indeed be
impossible to adopt proposals, and we'd have to recalculate everything
back to where the rules came to have this form!

The best fix for this is to amend R106 to say something like this:
Replace:
      A player specifically permitted by the Rules to distribute a
      Proposal CAN distribute the proposal by publishing it with the
      clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
      distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
      distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
      whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.  Removing
      a proposal from the Pool by a means other than initiating an
      Agoran Decision to adopt it is secured.
with:
      A player specifically permitted by the Rules to distribute a
      Proposal CAN distribute the proposal by initiating the Agoran
      decision of whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.
      When a proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Pool.  Removing a proposal from the Pool by a means other than
      initiating an Agoran Decision to adopt it is secured.

This fix authorizes the promotor to initiate the decision directly, and
makes the initiation the means of distribution, rather than distribution
the means of initiation, thus putting in the R107 notice requirements.

An orthogonal note.  From R1607/28:
      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.
means that technically, a proposal is not defined as having an ID number
until *after* it is distributed.   Fortunately, by R107/11, it is not
necessary for the ID number to be "officially" assigned to perform
the distribution (otherwise distribution would be impossible), it is
enough to say (in the usual order of things) that the indicated number,
while not being an ID number, serves to clearly identifies the matter
to be decided the instant before it is distributed (and thus allows
the decision to be initiated) and then (the instant after distribution)
the ID number is officially assigned to the proposal in question.
This convenience in ordering is no more difficult to accept then, for
example, allowing players to assign AI or perform actions on "the
following proposal" when they submit a proposal.

Therefore, the success/failure of assigning ID numbers is to be
considered subsequent to whether the proposal was distributed; if the
proposal was not distributed, no ID number could be assigned; if the
proposal was distributed, the ID number may or may not be assigned
(or in fact could be assigned in a later message).
