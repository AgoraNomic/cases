Caller's Arguments:

I don't believe this does anything useful; this would change my score to
"-12118.17578+91521.12456i0", which is meaningless, and thus "fails".
I'm not entirely clear whether it destroyed your 0 or not.


Gratuitous arguments by G.:

The clause in question is:
>   The specified player's score (the Old
>   Score) is changed to the New Score as follows, and the
>   specified operators are destroyed:
>
>    (New Score) = (Old Score) [specified operators].

The question is whether all brackets and parentheses are removed for the
calculation, none are removed, or just the square brackets are removed
(as is common in computer documentation, and sometimes for comments in
our own proposals etc.).

If the rounded parentheses are left in, the play becomes:

(New Score) = (-12118.17578 + 91521.12456i)0

which is multiplication by 0 (or if nothing is removed, by [0].

For what it's worth, I wrote that clause several times with different
sorts of parenthetical arrangements and ended up with this version
"for clarity" in separating the different variables, but I can't
remember if I meant the difference between () and [] to be meaningful;
if I did, I didn't put much thought into it.

Also note Rule 2419: "If a player's score [...] cannot be determined
by reasonable effort, it is 0."  though I wouldn't use that clause,
it would mean anyone could set a score to 0 by making an unclear play.

Judge omd's Arguments:

The wording in question:

>    (New Score) = (Old Score) [specified operators].

Arguments for () as part of the expression (attempt succeeds):

- Distinction between () and [], since it generally makes sense in
arithmetic to wrap something in () but not [].

- The () is there, so it should be part of the expression.

Arguments for () not part of the expression (attempt fails):

- Intent, as specified in the gratuitous arguments.

- Some kind of surrounding punctuation is appropriate in both cases to
group the words; both () and [] can be used for this purpose, without
it necessarily meaning to be part of the expression.

- It's unusual for the left side of an assignment to be parenthesized.

- In UNIX and elsewhere, [] is often used as a placeholder for optional text:

usage: ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

Clause 4 of the Operations Manual has a player "specify a set of
operators e possesses", which could be empty.  So the
punctuation could reflect the fact that only the "specified operators"
part can be empty.

- Off-hand, I also thought it wasn't.

A third possibility is that it is too ambiguous.  In this case, if the
outcome would depend on the presence or absence of the parentheses,
"the new score cannot be determined to be a specific, known complex
number", so the attempt still fails.

I think the second and third possibilities collectively are more
likely than the first.  Therefore, I judge FALSE.
