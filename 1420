    A Claim of Error arising from an error in the list of Watchers
    contained in the Registrar's Census Report would be invalid.

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1431 (Claims of Error) states, in part:

     A Claim of Error is a public message claiming that a specific public
     communication misrepresents the actual Game State, and documenting
     the nature of the error.

The term "Watcher" does not appear anywhere in the Ruleset.  Under the
Rules, a Watcher who has not registered as a player has no standing
different from any other non-Player, and, likewise, there is no reason
that a Watcher who has registered as a player (as Cecilius would
mistakenly appear to be in the Registrar's latest Census Report) would
have standing different from any other Player.

Therefore, whether one is listed as a Watcher or not has no effect on the
state of the game, and thus an error in the listing cannot be said to form
a communication that "misrepresents the actual Game State."  That is,
unless the Rules provide a definition modifying the plain English sense of
the term "Game State."

Excluding the Rule cited above, the term "Game State" (with variations in
capitalisation) appears only in four rules: Rules 101 (Obey the Rules),
1551 (Documents Subject to Ratification), 1698 (The Proposal System is
Protected), and 2016 (Contested Proposals).  In none of these Rules is a
definition provided.  Therefore, the plain English interpretation of the
term must operate.

Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

The list of Watchers has been a part of the Registrar's report for quite
some time.  The status of Watcher is an established game custom.
Accordingly, I find that Watcher status IS a part of the Game State.

The Registrar is not required to publish the list of Watchers; this list
is provided as a courtesy.  Still, as long as the Registrar is reporting
on Watchers, the report does need to be properly maintained.  A COE
helps to fix goofs in such reports, and so would be valid in this case.
I return a decision of FALSE.
