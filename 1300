Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1470/5 states in part:

      (d) Whenever the Bank incurs a debt to any other entity, the
          Bank shall, as soon as possible and by its Executor or by
          one of its Limited Executors, either satisfy that debt by
          transferring appropriate Properties to the creditor, or
          dispute the debt by whatever means are appropriate in the
          situation.

This clause makes satisfying (or disputing) the Bank's debts in a currency
a specific duty of the recordkeepor of that currency (who is elsewhere
made a Limited Executor).

So can the Officer be issued a Private Order to do eir duty?  I argue yes,
by Rule 1793.  While 1793 was originally written to ensure that Orders
pertaining to an Office follow the Officeholder, they *specifically allow*
that such an Order "may be directed"; in other words, may be issued at an
Officer to perform eir duty.  If such an Order is permitted (and
regulated), it is possible to make such an Order.  Because this regulation
does not limit the type of order (Private or otherwise), the lack of
exception in the definition specifically leaves such an Order
unregulated, and (by the much-abused Rule 101) allowable.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1793/0 (Power=1)
Orders

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.

========================================================================

Judge Hooloovoo's Arguments:

 A Limited Executor of the Bank is empowered to transfer property and
satisfy debts of the Bank, by rule 1470, when rules require it. An
Order cannot be valid if it is not authorized by the rules somewhere as
being valid. The type of Order that may be issued to an Limited Executor
to satisfy a debt of the Bank is not regulated by the rules, and
therefore the Order can be of any type, by Rule 101. Private Orders are
therefore valid Orders for this purpose.

========================================================================

Judge Hooloovoo's Evidence:

Rule 1470/5 (Power=1)
The Bank

      (a) There is an entity known as the Bank. The Bank has Mint
          Authority. The Bank is the Mintor of each Bank Currency.

      (b) The Executor of the Bank is the Treasuror. Each Recordkeepor
          of each Bank Currency is a Limited Executor of the Bank.

      (c) The Executor of the Bank, and each Limited Executor, is
          authorized to transfer Property from the Bank as and when
          the Rules explicitly require or permit it. Transfers of
          Property from the Bank which are made without being
          explicitly required or permitted by the Rules are
          unauthorized.

      (d) Whenever the Bank incurs a debt to any other entity, the
          Bank shall, as soon as possible and by its Executor or by
          one of its Limited Executors, either satisfy that debt by
          transferring appropriate Properties to the creditor, or
          dispute the debt by whatever means are appropriate in the
          situation.

      (e) The Treasuror has sole authority to forgive debts owed to
          the Bank, in whole or in part. This power may only be
          exercised:
          (1) pursuant to a properly-issued Order; or
          (2) Without Objection, at the Treasuror's discretion.

Rule 101/1 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in
      effect, in the form in which they are currently in effect.
      However, a Player besides the Speaker may always deregister
      rather than continue to play.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
      permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permit it.  Any change to the game state which would
      make it impossible to make arbitrary modifications to the Rules
      by any combination of actions by Players does not occur, any
      Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of
      the first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
      (Immutable) and 201-219 (Mutable).

Appellant Oerjan's Arguments:

I call for the appeal of this as the Judge failed to consider the
properness of the Order.
