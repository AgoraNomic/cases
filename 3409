Exhibit by ais523:

Evidence: the above-quoted message, that has the title "OFF: [Arbitor]
CFJ 3408 assigned to omd", but does not list anything but the text of
the CFJ in the body of the message.
Arguments: I think (this is from memory, I may be wrong) we've decided
that the subject line is sufficient to assign a number to the CFJ, on
the basis that it causes general agreement as to which CFJ the number
refers to. Is it also sufficient to assign a judge? Nothing in the body
contradicts it, but nothing in the body refers to the subject either,
which is normally too low a standard to perform an action by
announcement.

Exhibit by Murphy:

Precedent is something like "the subject line may provide context,
provided it doesn't contradict the body". Arguably, for a reply with
subject = an action (particularly one that fulfills a duty) and body =
nothing but quoted text, it makes more sense to interpret "they intended
to do that and it was effective" than "they missed adding to the body
and also changed the subject in a curiously specific but nevertheless
ineffective manner".

JUDGE'S ARGUMENTS
First, whether it worked or not, it is Bad Form for an Officer.  In
general, Don't Do This.
Second, ID Numbers are currently undefined for Judicial Cases, so
this will focus on the case assignment to omd; number assignment
is informal so this "worked" informally.
The "success" of information in a subject line has been found in
the past to depend on the clarity of the message text.  Here are
some possible tests of effectiveness:
   1.  Are there multiple actions that can be inferred?  No.
   2.  Is there a real doubt as to what is intended?  No.
   3.  Is timing an issue?  (multiple events in the message).  No.
   4.  Is anything purposefully obfuscated?  No.
   5.  Does the message text infer the type of action that can be
       made clear from the subject line?  (A CFJ is quoted with the
       term CFJ being fairly clear).
All of this points to successful communication.
On the other side, we have:
   1.  Does the message text alone infer an action took place?  No.
Not to get around it, but this is a missing piece that SHOULD be
there.  But in balance, the clarity of the overall message is
sufficient.  TRUE.
