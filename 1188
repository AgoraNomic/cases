Caller's Arguments: 

This is a direct consequence of Rule 911, clause iv).

======================================================================

Evidence attached by the Caller: 

Rule 911/8 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected in order to reach a decision about the consideration
      mandated by the appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players, called
      Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the Justices for each
      Board, as follows, until three eligible Justices have been
      selected;  The Speaker is selected, if eligible; The Justiciar
      is selected, if eligible; The CotC is selected, if eligible; Any
      remaining positions are then filled by random selection, by the
      CotC, from all remaining eligible Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected to serve on that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.
      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider.
       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration when it was called, and this
           restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
           being selected by the CotC for the Board.
        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.

      A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
      replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
      consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
      Courts of the appointment.

======================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

Caller claims that the Statement is a direct consequence of Rule 911, 
clause iv, which states that Players ineligible to Judge a CFJ are 
ineligible to serve on a Board of Appeals for that CFJ unless that 
condition would prevent there being three eligible Players.  

Wes was the only Player eligible to Judge CFJ 1183.  Kolja was doubly 
ineligible, for e had requested that e not be selected as Judge.  It 
might seem that only Wes could be assigned to the Board of Appeals 
(thus causing iv to kick in and allow any Players, even Kolja to be 
possibly selected); however, according to Rule 1871, the Players 
made ineligible to Judge a CFJ by having had their turn were not 
ineligible to serve on the Board of Appeals for that CFJ.  There were 
at least three Players eligible to serve on the Board of Appeals 
(in particular, elJefe, Kolja, Peekee, Steve, and Wes were not
eligible) without reinstating eligibility by iv.  So Kolja was not 
eligible to serve on the Board of Appeals for CFJ 1183, and should 
not have been assigned as a Justice on that CFJ.
