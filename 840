  Judged TRUE by Jtael, Tue, 5 Mar 1996 12:40:36 -0800 (PST)

======================================================================
Arguments :

The statement is self-evident.

======================================================================
Decision of Judge Jtael:  TRUE

  favor, in not-quite-judging this on Jan 16, found no evidence that 
Wes had pubished a ruleset during the week of Jan 1.  My own inquiries
also have turned up no Wes-published ruleset.  This failure to publish
most obviously violates 1051/3.  

  Despite my lack of a high-quality dictionary, I issue the following
Injunction:

  Wes' Formal Apology must contain the words "Well", "twizzle", "my",
"gleichschaltung", "and", "call", "me", and "stesichorean".

======================================================================

Evidence:

Rule 1051/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Office of the Rulekeepor
 
      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      The Rulekeepor shall receive a weekly Salary of 5 Points.
