Caller's Arguments:

Arguments FOR:

The only issue here is whether the intent is clear and unambiguous, which
ultimately will come down to some criterion of reasonable effort. The only
information that needs to be verified is whether 1) there were at least 41
ritual acts, and that 2) none of those have had a ritual number declared in
response. Well, I posit that those two facts are patently obvious, even
though it might be unreasonably hard to identify specifically which acts
were those. But their identity, alas, is irrelevant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Janet's Arguments:

Although the caller states that this case turns only on whether eir
attempts were sufficiently clear, it also depends on whether 4st's
purported declarations of the ritual number as 10 to 15 succeeded (at [0]).

I find that these purported declarations were not successful. R2680/1
phrases the definitions of ritual acts as ongoing and present tense.
Similarly, the enabling of declaring the ritual number is phrased as
present and ongoing. Thus, I find that the ENABLING of declaring a
ritual number attaches when the ritual act is performed and does not
apply retrospectively past when R2680 was enacted. Thus, the purported
declarations from 10 to 15 were referencing events that were not ritual
acts.

However, the caller raises the argument that R2680 does not require the
declaration of a ritual number to include a reference to a specific
event. I find that this is not correct. R2680's phrasing of "for each
ritual act" suggests that the declaration applies to a specific ritual
act, and thus the specification of the action must include the specific
ritual act. The caller's purported declarations even seem to accept
that, as they attempt to include a reference to a specific ritual act,
rather than just having a raw declaration.

Thus, I find that 4st's purported declarations from 10-15 were invalid
because they failed to specify the required ritual act.

Although this finding means that I do not need to reach the clarity of
caller's purported declarations from 16-41 (sine they are invalid due to
not being at most 1 greater than some previous declaration), I will
continue to resolve the controversy anyway.

Having found that a specific ritual act must be referenced for a
declaration to be valid, the question is now what communication standard
must be met. I find that the standard is equivalent to the normal
"specify" standard. The only clarity standard weaker than that in the
rules is used in R869 registration, which is explicitly and deliberately
weaker than "by announcement" (and includes "reasonably clearly and
reasonably unambiguously"). Given that the only weaker standard has
explicit and clear wording, I find that, under the "game custom" factor,
it is not reasonable to read in a weaker clarity standard than "specify".

Having found that specific ritual acts must be referenced and having
identified the clarity standard, suffice it to say that the purported
declarations do not meet it. It is not reasonable effort for a ritual
officer to identify the Nth ritual act ever performed.

Since the declarations from 16-41 were invalid, no unique positive
multiple of 41 was declared as a ritual number, and the attempt to have
qualifying players lift the First Speaker in a powerful dance around the
fountain failed.

HELD:

 1. The ability to declare a ritual number attaches to specific ritual acts.
 2. The ability to declare a ritual number in response to a ritual act
    attaches when it occurs, and thus does not apply retrospectively
    before R2680 was enacted.
 3. The relevant ritual act must be referenced as part of a ritual
    number declaration.
 4. The clarity standard for referencing a ritual act from a ritual
    number declaration is "specifying".
 5. 4st's purported declarations of the ritual number from 10 to 15 were
    invalid.
 6. Caller's purported declarations failed due to the specified ritual
    numbers being too large.
 7. Additionally, caller's purported declarations were invalid due to
    failing to meet the clarity standard for referencing the relevant
    ritual act.
 8. Because the declaration of 41 were invalid, the qualified players
    did not lift the First Speaker in a powerful dance around the fountain.

Judged FALSE.


Judge Janet's Evidence:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2680/1 (Power=1)
Ritual Paper Dance

      Firstly: Each of these is a ritual act:
      - Performing a cabinet order
      - Assigning a judgement
      - Awarding ribbons
      - Once per week per report type, publishing a report
      - Once per week per player, nominating for office
      - Once per week per player, voting
      
      Secondly: Once for each ritual act, any player, including the
      player who performed the ritual act, CAN, by announcement, declare
      the ritual number. A ritual number is a number that starts at 0,
      and can be at most 1 greater than any other declared ritual
      number. A purported attempt to declare the ritual number is a
      self-ratifying attestation that such attempt was successful and
      that the ritual number was declared.
      
      Thirdly: Once, each time a unique positive multiple of 41 is
      declared, in the same message the declarer CAN, by announcement,
      have qualifying players lift The First Speaker in a powerful dance
      around the fountain, while also announcing that those players'
      gain 1 radiance, in such a way that is unambiguous and clear, so
      that in fact, those players' do gain 1 radiance. This does not
      increase their radiance by 2, nor does it increase it by 3 or 4. 5
      is right out.
      
      Fourthly: Players are qualifying under this rule if:
      - they are active
      - do not have the highest radiance
      - are not tied for the highest radiance

Rule 869/51 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any entity (including a group of entities confederated with the
      intent of forming a single person under this Rule) that is or ever
      was able to willingly communicate original ideas is a person.
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are
      persons.
      
      Questions about personhood are to be resolved equitably, with
      regard for the good-faith of those involved and the customs of
      honorable play.
      
      Citizenship is a secured person switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. A registered
      person is a Player. To "register" someone is to flip that person's
      Citizenship switch from Unregistered to Registered.
      
      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
      intends to become a player at that time. No person can be a player
      if e is part of another player or another player is part of em.
      
      A player, acting as emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player)
      by announcement. If e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered
      for 30 days.
      
      A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
      CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
      that person's willful consent.
      
      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
      or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
      unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
