Judge Taral's Arguments:

Peekee, may you burn in Zandru's coldest hell. If this is what I think
it is, it has been done before, and if I recall correctly, the outcome
was an ugly metagame agreement that Kelly *still* hasn't forgiven.

There's no evidence either way, so I'm going to punt. If someone wants
to know for sure, I suggest asking.
