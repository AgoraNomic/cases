Caller's Arguments:

Proposal 7216 purportedly added the second text and removed
the first, but this leaves no way to add proposals to the Pool, which
would make Agora ossified, so Rule 1698 (Agora Is A Nomic) should have
cancelled it. However, the next published Full Logical Ruleset gives a
version of Rule 2350 that contains both.

Caller's Evidence:

 Short Logical Ruleset, May 3:
 {
  Rule 2350/1 (Power=3)
  Proposals

     A proposal is a fixed body of text which has been made into a
     proposal using a process specifically described in the Rules.

     A player CAN create a proposal by publishing ("submitting") a
     body of text and an associated title with a clear indication
     that it is intended to become a proposal, which places the
     proposal in the Proposal Pool.  The author (syn. proposer) of a
     proposal is the player who submitted it.  A player CAN remove
     (syn. retract, withdraw) a proposal e authored from the Proposal
     Pool by announcement.

     A co-author of a proposal is a person (other than its author)
     unambiguously identified as such by its author when it was
     submitted.

 Full Logical Ruleset, May 5:
 {
  Rule 2350/2 (Power=3)
  Proposals

     A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text.  A
     player CAN create a proposal by announcement, specifying its
     text and optionally specifying the following attributes:

     * An associated title.
     * A list of co-authors (which must be persons other than the
       author).
     * An adoption index and Chamber.

     Once a proposal is created, none of its attributes can be
     changed.  The author (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person
     who submitted it.

Judge omd's Arguments:

I belatedly judge CFJs 3215-16 TRUE, because as I mentioned shortly
after they were called, there are more unusual ways to introduce
proposal or cause rule changes that would prevent Agora from being
ossified in any case.
