==============================  CFJ 1650  ==============================

    a message labelled as a "distribution of proposals" and detailing
    the text and other attributes of proposals, as has been periodically
    published during the first quarter of 2007, in the absence of public
    disagreement over voter eligibility, qualifies as a set of R107
    notices initiating the Agoran decisions on the adoption of those
    proposals

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

The truth of the statement depends on a message in question qualifying
against each of Rule 107's criteria.  Since Rule 107 says "contain"
and not "explicitly contain", I interpret it as allowing reasonable
equivalents and implications, in accordance with Rule 754(1)'s general
approval of unambiguous synonyms.

  (a) The matter to be decided.  The messages in question have generally
      said "distribution of proposals" followed by a list of proposals
      being distributed.  I interpret this as reasonably equivalent to
      "deciding the adoption of <proposal>" for each proposal.

  (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
      enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  I
      interpret "distribution of proposals" as reasonably implying
      that the voters are the active players, and the statement of
      this CFJ restricts itself to cases in which there is no public
      disagreement over voter eligibility (e.g. whether a given
      player is active).

  (c) The identity of the vote collector.  I interpret "distribution
      of proposals" as reasonably implying the identity of the vote
      collector.  In particular, the statement of this CFJ restricts
      itself to cases during the first quarter of 2007, during which
      time the vote collector was the Speaker; and, at the time this
      CFJ was called, there were no outstanding disputes over the
      identity of the Speaker at any time during that quarter.

  (d) Any additional information required by the rules for this
      announcement.  I do not know of any such information, so this
      criterion is vacuously satisfied.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Evidence:

Rule 107/3 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  To be valid, this notice must contain
      the following information:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
          proposal 4781").

      (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
          enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
          particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
          always sufficient for this purpose.

      (c) The identity of the vote collector.

      (d) Any additional information required by the rules for this
          announcement.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  This rule takes precedence over any rule which
      would require a voting period for some decision to be shorter
      than seven days.
