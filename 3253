Gratuitous Arguments by OscarMeyr:

WoodsPam was clearly verifying that e properly registered as a player, and did
not explicitly call for judgment in eir message.  I recommend finding FALSE.

Judge ais523's Arguments:

Calling CFJs is not registering, and so requires
the use of the standard R478 mechanism for taking actions, rather than
the intentionally weaker R869 mechanism. Among other things, this
requires specifying the action (in this case, calling a CFJ); asking a
question doesn't specify calling a CFJ, nor does it imply calling a CFJ
strongly enough to be unambiguous. (As an alternative argument for
FALSE, CFJ 3237 found that a message cannot create a CFJ without
unambiguously specifying the statement to be inquired into, and that
message didn't.)
