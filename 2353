Caller's Arguments:

I recommend double rests; comex is clearly GUILTY.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Wooble:

comex didn't dispute eir guilt, only the extent to which e
should be punished.  This early in the NoV era, I think this counts as
reasonable dispute rather than obstruction.

I'd agree with this; I'd recommend the usual 2-rest punishment for one
of them, but DISCHARGE for the other as multiple failing to judge
(especially on linked CFJs!) is not particularly worse than single
failing to judge.

Judge Taral's Arguments:

GUILTY/DISCHARGE. I don't want to discourage linked cases.
