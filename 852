======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, 25 January 1996, 08:56 +0100
  Assigned to Vlad, 25 January 1996, 11:42 MET
  Defaulted by Vlad, 1 February 1996, 11:42 MET
  Assigned to Wes, 2 February 1996, 15:00 MET
  Judged TRUE by Wes, 7 February 1996, 18:54 -0800 (PST)

======================================================================

Requested Injunction:
I request an Injunction to annotate 1467 with this Statement.

Relevant Rules : 1467, 1491.

======================================================================

Arguments :

Another simple one. Rule 1467 states that "The Mintor of a Currency 
is the Nomic Entity which is authorized to create and destroy units 
of that Currency." Well, that's all, really. The Mintor is _the_ 
Entity authorized to do that, so no other Entity may do so.

For a more powerful argument, consider 1011 : the only specified
action which results in creation or destruction of units of a 
Currency is the intervention of the Mintor. So units of a Currency
may *not* be changed by any action other than the intervention
of the Mintor.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

We hereby Judge this CFJ TRUE. 

It is quite obvious that at this time, the Rules quite clearly state
that only the Mintor of a Currency may create or destroy instances of
that Currency. 

If able to do so, we hereby grant the requested Injunction (Annotation
of Rule 1467) and state that the affecting Rules are 1467 and 1471.
