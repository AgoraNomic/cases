JUDGEMENT 17 (Alexx) Tue, 24 Aug 93, 16:00 PDT

STATEMENT:
Since Rule 383 reads:

> 383.  Repeal of 308
>
> Rule 202, as amended by rules 302 and 308, is hereby repealed.

and since Rule 202 is *not* amended by rules 302 and 308 at this
moment in time, Therefore, Rule 383 has no effect.

[If 383 were to remain in force, and somehow things changed in such a
way that a rule numbered 202 *was* amended by Rules which were
numbered 302, and 308, then that rule 202 would then be repealed.]
