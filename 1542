Caller's Arguments:

The text of rule 2076 contains text that might be
interpreted as defining the card. However, it doesn't say anywhere that
this rule is meant to define cards (as other rules with similar effect
do, e.g. 2071). Without this context, the rules text has no legal
effect.

One may argue that the rules title "Card cards" implies that the rule
aims to define cards, but according to 1485, a rule title "is not part
of the Rule itself and has no effect on the meaning or application of
the Rule, being merely a convenience for the Players.".

I am aware that judging this CFJ true will create a messy bookkeeping
cleanup for cards, but I would still prefer that to establishing
precedence that meaningless rules texts are made to have legal
implications based on arbitrary assumptions and interpretations not
based on the rules text itself.

      * Caption: Hot Potato
        Quota: 1
        Elements: Persistent
        Exploit: Transfer this Card to another entity. If that entity
          does not post to a Public Forum the phrase "Hot Potato"
          within 48 hours, they are guilty of the Class 1 Infraction
          of Dropping the Potato which you are authorized to Report.

        Elements: None
        Exploit: Discard X cards from your hand.  For a fee of
          X Kudos, draw X cards.  Do not include this card as
          one of the discarded cards.

      * Caption: Rebel Rabble
        Elements: Budgeted,
                  Restricted [Rebellious]
        Exploit: For a fee of N Kudos, where N is the current number
          of Rebellious Players, increase the effective number of
          Rebellious Players by 1 for 10 days (which is one week
          on the Revolutionary Calendar).  Count the day this Card
          is played as day #1.

Rule 1485/8 (Power=1)
Titles for Rules

      Each Rule has a Title, which is a single line of text
      containing not more than 60 characters.  The Title must be
      listed by the Rulekeepor along with the Rule.  However, the
      Title is not part of the Rule itself and has no effect on the
      meaning or application of the Rule, being merely a convenience
      for the Players.

      A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify a Title for
      the new Rule.  If it does not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the
      new Rule's Title.

      The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the Title of a Rule
      Without Objection.

========================================================================

Judge Sherlock's Arguments:

Rule 2069 (Card Definitions) explains what it takes for a piece of text to
be recognized as a Card:

      II. Definitions

      The Rules may define a Class of Card by specifying a Caption, a
      Quota, zero or more Elements, and zero or more Exploits. All
      Cards of the same Class shall be identical and fungible. Each
      individual instance of a Card shall be considered to be a Copy
      of that Class of Card.

The text of the rule in question begins:

       Caption:  Your Turn
       Elements: Budgeted
       Exploit:  A Player you name must play or discard a card in the
                 next 72 hours, or commit the Class-1 Infraction of
                 Delay of Game, reportable by you.

There is no requirement in the rules that a Card be specified as such in
order to exist.  It must simply list a Caption and a Quota.  There is a
Caption of "Your Turn" and the Element Budgeted is included, so there is a
Quota.  Hence, there is a Card known by the Caption "Your Turn".
