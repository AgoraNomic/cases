To the misty peaks of learnéd elders
I call, asking that they pass judgement on
this simple statement, and that we defer
all further quarrels, fights and duels, and on:
"It is impossible to issue writs which
start a poetry duel challenge.” Held:
The rule supporting such a hostile pitch
does not spell out to whom to pay the geld.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge G.'s Arguments:

So first:  I think, for the good of the game, that judges should be
flexible in interpreting Rules that have an obviously purposeful rhyme
scheme or metrical structure, and allow loose synonyms etc. in the name
of creativity.

With that in mind, I translate the sentence in question to prose, as
follows:

>    A player can issue a Poetry Duel Challenge once a month, to another
>    player who has not remitted in a different Poetry Duel challenge,
>    by paying 10 shinies and announcing eir intent to do so.

Pretty clear except:  pay 10 shinies to whom?  Can we infer Agora as a
recipient when the rules are silent to the recipient?

Unfortunately for the cleverness of the rule, I find that Rule 2166 is
explicit in defining “pay” as transferring “to another entity”.  So, “to
pay” without a recipient isn’t a mechanism explicitly defined in the
rules.  This may have worked in the past, but R2125 has a relatively new
strict requirement for mechanism specification:

>      A Restricted Action CAN only be performed as described by the
>      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
>      Rules for performing the given action.

And so to say you can do something by “paying” for it without adding a
recipient does not explicitly specify a mechanism to this new standard.
So as the Caller states, it is TRUE that it is impossible to issue
writs.  TRUE.


Judge G.'s Evidence:

Poetry Duel Challenge Writ

A player CAN issue the title's writ
once a month to another, who
this month a different writ they yet remit,
by having the first player pays its due
of ten shinies and announces intent.
If a party remits, they are disgraced;
else the pair must to the public present
a poem each which then Agorans be faced
with a Decision of which one is better.
Each task a timely manner it be done,
The winner gains the loser as debtor,
of whose function this rule shall provide none.
