Caller's Arguments:

Since I have a Magenta (and transparent) ribbon this would be easy to
judge IRRELEVANT as I can think of no recorded game state that is
affected, but I kindly ask the Judge to look into the merits of the idea
more deeply towards a true or false.

In general, subject lines are not directly actionable but are usable by
reference.  For example, if X is a by-announcement action, saying "I do X"
in the subject line fails, but saying in the body "I do the action in the
subject line" where the subject line is "X" is generally no different than
referencing a quoted action by another player and saying "I do the same".
There are good reasons for not taking subject lines on their own as
by-announcement actions, as subject lines are preserved in replies,
changed by the mailing list header, are not "in sequence" with the text
body for multiple actions, etc. so a subject line on its own does not
clearly set forth intent to perform an action.

The method for earning a magenta ribbon in R2438/26 is not "by
announcement" however, but:
       Magenta (M): When, during Agora's Birthday, a person publicly
       acknowledges it, that person earns a Magenta Ribbon.

which isn't subject to the "setting forth intent to perform that action"
requirement in 478/40[*].

Now R478 *does* stipulate that to "publish" something (and thus to
publicly acknowledge something) is to put it in the message's body ("the
body contains that thing").  However, in this case, I stipulate that the
blank message in the body serves the function of "specifying" or directing
the reader to view the subject line as the important part of the message,
which does the job of earning G. a magenta ribbon.

As further evidence, I note from the archive link that almost everyone who
did more clearly earn a magenta ribbon did so by replying to that
particular message.  G.'s message was the first public indication of the
2022 birthday made on the day itself, so it did absolutely serve the
function of announcing (and therefore acknowledging in a suitably public
manner) Agora's 2022 Birthday.

[*]
Rule 478/40 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player shall
      be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall any person
      create physical or technological obstacles that unduly favor some
      players' fora access over others.
  
      Publicity is a secured forum switch with values Public,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.

      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.

      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. To
      "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
      whose body contains that thing. To do something "publicly" is
      to do that thing within a public message.

      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.

      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified. Allowing actions performed by
      sending a message to take place simultaneously must be done
      explicitly and is secured at power 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Jason's Arguments:

I hold that Rule 478's standard of doing something "within" a public
message only permits examining the body of the message itself. That body
may incorporate something else (like the subject) of the message by
reference, but the body of the message is ultimately what matters, and
all evaluations of whether the message does something "publicly" must be
rooted in the explicit text of the body. A message with an empty string
as a body does not explicitly reference any other content, and thus does
not permit the evaluation of any other content (including its subject)
in determining its meaning.

To the extent that Rule 478 is ambiguous with respect to this
requirement, I find that it is contrary to the best interests of the
game to allow something to be done "publicly" in a subject merely by an
empty message drawing attention to the subject line. This potentially
opens up other cans of worms about what empty or nearly empty bodies
might implicitly reference, compared to the relative ease of explicitly
including a reference in a message body when a player deliberately wants
to reference a subject.

The fact that the message apparently served as acknowledgement of
Agora's Birthday for other players does not mean that it met the
standard of doing so "publicly". G. did not "publicly" acknowledge
Agora's Birthday in 2022, and thus did not earn a Magenta Ribbon in 2022.

Judged FALSE.
