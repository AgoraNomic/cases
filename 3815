Caller's Arguments:

I don't think "title" is ever explicitly defined in the rules. Is the
exact sequence of Unicode characters important? Or is it just the
English-language words made up of those characters? If I included
invisible Unicode characters in a proposal title, so that it looked like
plain ASCII but wasn't, would the answer be any different?

Judge Cuddle Beam's Arguments:

The title in question is "𝒥𝓊𝒹𝒾𝒸𝒾𝒶𝓁 𝒥𝑜𝒸𝓊𝓁𝒶𝓇𝒾𝓉𝓎 𝒜𝒸𝓉".

We've had other languages and special symbols interpreted before (CFJ 
3536, 3544) provided that it is understandable. CFJ 3530 provides a limit 
to how obscure the symbols and language used can be before it is no longer
reasonably understandable and dismissed for purposes of play.

I don't find this overly obscure, because it's fairly easily readable.

This is normal English, but in a cool font. It says "Judicial Jocularity
Act".

"Judicial Jocularity Act" and "𝒥𝓊𝒹𝒾𝒸𝒾𝒶𝓁 𝒥𝑜𝒸𝓊𝓁𝒶𝓇𝒾𝓉𝓎 𝒜𝒸𝓉" are the same 
thing but written in different fonts, and the font used is not relevant 
for differences between titles (as long as it is reasonably 
understandable).

I judge TRUE
