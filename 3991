Caller's Arguments:

Arguments for TRUE: Dreams aren't really defined in the rules so "Dream of
Victories" might be a valid value for a mindset, especially since it's
referred to in the definition of Dream of Victory.

Arguments for FALSE: Since dreams aren't really defined in the rules, you
can't plan to set it to any dream besides the Dream of Wandering. The Dream
of Victory and the Dream of Victories might also be the same thing, given
the dream of victories is referenced in the dream of victory effects and
it's pretty obvious it was a mistake/typo. Or maybe the list of things
called "Dream of" whatever is enough to define those things as dreams and
anything not listed there as not dreams, as intended, so the Dream of
Victories can't be flipped to since it isn't a dream.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Jason's Arguments:

The capitalization of "Dream" in "and any Dream" of the second paragraph
of Rule 2675 is extremely suggestive that "Dream" is a term of art, and
not a natural language term. This effect is only enhanced by the list of
"Dream of X" later in the rule. To the extent that the text does not
require this reading explicitly or implicitly, it is most certainly
ambiguous in what it actually requires, thus allowing the Rule 217
factors to apply. Common sense clearly weighs in favor of this working,
and the best interests of the game and game custom weigh against an
alternate reading where the values of the switch are nebulously defined
(especially for a tracked switch). Although this reading renders the
usage of "Dream of Wandering [...] and any Dream" redundant, this slight
contortion is both still consistent with the text and most consistent
with the R217 factors.

As such, I find that the list of "Dream of X" in the final paragraph of
Rule 2675 is an exhaustive list of "Dreams" for the purposes of the Rule.

The third paragraph of Rule 2675 authorizes Planning to Flip one's own
Mindset to any valid value by announcement. Since "Dream of Victory" is
a possible value, Pilgore met the "clearly and unambiguously" standard
required for specification of a by announcement. E also obviously met
the intent requirement. Thus, Pilgore successfully Planned to Flip eir
Mindset to the value Dream of Victories.

I have seen no evidence that Pilgore attempted to Plan to Flip eir
Mindset at any later date before the beginning of September. Thus, at
the beginning of September, when the wandering occurred, eir Mindset was
flipped to Dream of Victory.

Judged FALSE.

Rule 2675/0 (Power=2)
Dream of Wandering

      The Dreamor is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
      track of the dreams of all active players.

      Mindset is a secured active player switch, tracked by the Dreamor
      in eir monthly report, with possible values Dream of Wandering
      (the default) and any Dream.

      An active player CAN Plan to Flip eir own Mindset, specifying any
      valid value for eir Mindset, by announcement.  When the rules
      state that the wandering occurs, every active player's Mindset is
      set to the value e most recently specified by Planning to Flip. If
      a player did not Plan to Flip eir Mindset switch since the last
      wandering, it not Flipped.

      The wandering occurs at the beginning of each month.

      At any time, each active player is either a Sleeping Dreamer
      (Default), a New Dreamer, or a Recurring Dreamer. The state of
      each player is included in the Dreamor's monthly report, which
      SHALL be published in a timely fashion from the beginning of the
      month.

      If an active player's Mindset is flipped when the wandering
      occurs, e becomes a New Dreamer; otherwise, e becomes a Recurring
      dreamer.

      The following rules apply to each active player based on that
      player's Mindset:
      - Dream of Victory: Upon a correct announcement of being the only
        player with eir Mindset Flipped to Dream of Victories, e wins
        the game. Upon winning the game, e has eir Mindset immediately
        Flipped to the Dream of Wandering and becomes a Sleeping
        Dreamer. While e is a New Dreamer, e CAN, once by announcement,
        gain 10 points, then become a Sleeping Dreamer.
      - Dream of Wealth: While e is a New or Recurring Dreamer, e CAN,
        once by announcement, grant 5 stamps of eir own type to emself,
        then become a Sleeping Dreamer.
      - Dream of Justice: While e is a New or Recurring Dreamer, e CAN,
        once by announcement, expunge up to 4 blots from emself, then
        become a Sleeping Dreamer.
      - Dream of Wandering: While e is a Recurring Dreamer, e CAN, once
        by announcement, set eir mindset to a specified Dream, and
        become a New Dreamer.
      - Dream of Machines: E CAN Flip the Device to either on or off
        with Agoran Consent.  E CAN act on behalf of the device to take
        any action the device CAN take by announcement with 1 support.
      - Dream of Beasts: E CAN buy bird food by paying a fee of 3
        boatloads of coins. E CAN buy a Beast Permit by paying a fee of
        40 boatloads of coins.  E CAN renew a Beast Permit by paying a
        fee of 20 boatloads of coins.
      - Dream of Gardens: While E is a New or Recurring Dreamer, E CAN
        once pay a fee of N stamps, specifying one stone e owns, and
        that stone has its escape chance reduced by N*5%, to a minimum
        of 0%, where N is a positive integer, then become a Sleeping
        Dreamer.  This reduction can only apply to one stone e owns.
        This reduction is removed after the Stonemason publishes a
        collection notice.
      - Dream of Power: Eir Voting Strength is 2 greater.

Rule 478/40 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player shall
      be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall any person
      create physical or technological obstacles that unduly favor some
      players' fora access over others.

      Publicity is a secured forum switch with values Public,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.

      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.

      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. To
      "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
      whose body contains that thing. To do something "publicly" is
      to do that thing within a public message.

      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.

      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified. Allowing actions performed by
      sending a message to take place simultaneously must be done
      explicitly and is secured at power 2.
