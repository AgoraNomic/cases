============================================================

Arguments of Caller (Ian):

I believe that the reason Rule 1472, among others, makes a specific
point of delegating the "Legal Responsibility" of reporting Changes in
Currencies to specific Players is because this information needs
to be brought to the attention of the Recordkeepor in a deliberate way.
Inclusion of the information (a change in Currency) in an official
report does not highlight the information sufficiently for the
Recordkeepor to pay attention to it and to act on it.

The Rules do not specify that Currency Changes need to be sent solely
to the Recordkeepor, nor do I believe that they should be.  However,
Game Custom offers us evidence that these Changes are usually brought
to the attention of the Recordkeepor in an unambiguous way.  For
instance, Voluntary Transfers of Points are usually send to the
Nomic-Business list with a Subject Line that identifies it as a Point
Transfer.  Kudo Transfers are usually likewise identified.  I believe
that Involuntary Transfers must be brought to the attention of the
Recordkeepor in the same way.

============================================================

Arguments of Judge (Dave B):

As Ian notes, "The Rules do not specify that Currency Changes need
to be sent solely to the Recordkeepor, not do I believe that they should be.
However, Game Custom offers us evidence that these Changes are usually brought
to the attention of the Recordkeepor in an unambiguous way."  As one of the
original players in Agora and holder of several Offices which required the
reporting of such involuntary transfers, I believe I can safely say that the
Game Custom is not as clear cut as Ian would like us to believe.  In my own
time as Clerk of the Courts, and I believe the practice has continued to the
present, the reports of the Assignment and Decision of a CFJ sent to the
Public Forum were the only notification sent to the Scorekeepor of point
changes resulting from judicial activities.  As Banker, I used to send the
Scorekeepor a private summary of Marks Interest in addition to the publicly
posted Banker's report.  So my own experience of Game Custom is that different
Offices have handled this reporting requirement in different ways and reject
Ian's argument that Game Custom requires bringing currency Changes to the
attention of the Recordkeepor in an unambiguous way.

============================================================

Evidence provided by Caller (Ian):

Rule 1472/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Transfer of Currencies

      The owner of a given Treasury may, at any time, transfer
      any or all of the units of Currency within that Treasury to any
      other Treasury, so long as this transfer is permitted by the
      Rules.  Such a transfer is known as a "voluntary" transfer.
      Voluntary transfers are restricted to positive quantities, and
      in no case may more of a given Currency be transferred from a
      Treasury than that Treasury possessed prior to the transfer.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency must be notified as soon as
      possible by the owner of the Treasury from which a
      voluntary transfer is made.  If a voluntary transfer is not
      reported to the Recordkeepor within seven days, it is cancelled
      and does not take place.

      Transfers which are not voluntary transfers ("involuntary"
      transfers) may only be made as specifically required by the
      Rules.  Such transfers must be reported to the Recordkeepors of
      the Currencies involved as soon as possible thereafter, by a
      Player specified by the Rules.  Involuntary transfers may be of
      any amount (limited only by MUQ rounding), and may involve
      amounts greater than the amount in the Treasury from which the
      transfer originates.

      If an involuntary transfer is not reported to the Recordkeepor
      within seven days, or there is no Rule which requires a Player
      to report the involuntary transfer, the transfer is cancelled
      and does not take place.

      All transfers take effect no sooner than the time the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency is informed of the transfer.
