Caller's Arguments:

Arguments FOR: This is extremely clear and unambiguous language.
Arguments AGAINST: This only provides support for one tabled intent, one
that doesn't exist.

Please find this CFJ as FOR. I find it ridiculous I have to ask this.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

For context, this came up on discord.  There was an assertion that
supporting "all" intents is a single atomic action where if any of
them would fail, they all do.  So if 4st previously supported one of
the intents and can't do so again, they all would fail.  But using the
term "every" avoids this problem and makes them fail or succeed
together.
