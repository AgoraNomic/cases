==============================  CFJ 1209  ==============================

    The change to the minimum wage on March 30, 2000 was invalid and the
    subsequent minimum wage PO's issued April 1, 2000 were incorrect.

========================================================================

Judge Chuck's Arguments:

Rule 1893 states, "(2) - (4) given above [which inlude the Minimum
Income] shall be given in integer multiples of 0.1, of the Basic
Officer Salary..."

"given in" here is quite problematic.  This CFJ would have been
fairly straightforward to judge if the author of this Rule had
simply stated, "...shall be integer multiples of 0.1..." which
is what, I suspect, e intended.  If this is what were written,
Lee's attempt to change the Minimum Income to 0.25 BOS clearly
would have failed.

But that is not what the Rule says.  It says that the Minimum
Income shall be given in integer multiples of 0.1, and it is
left up to me to determine what is meant by "given in".  (Given by
whom?  When?  In what context?)  While my initial instinct
in judging this CFJ was to find that it was in the best
interest of the game to interpret "shall be given in" to
mean "shall be", I soon realized that I could not twist the English
language to this extent--"shall be given in" does not mean "shall be",
and I could think of no example where it would.  One might as well
decide that "sends" actually means "eats".

I can only read this sentence so as to restrict the action of someone
setting ("giving") the value of the Minimum Income, and not a restriction
on the value of the Minimum Income itself.  That is, although R1893 requires
the Treasuror to use an integer multiple of 0.1 in setting the
Minimum Income, it does not prevent the Minimum Income from taking
on another value, should it be set to something else by someone acting in
violation of the Rules.  Rule 1906 permits the change Lee made.  Thus,
I conclude that although lee violated R1893 in setting the Minimum Income to
0.25 BOS, this did not prevent the Minimum Income from taking this value.
"Shall be given in" is not a synonym for "shall be."

Whether the change was "invalid" or not depends on the meaning of "invalid"
(illegal? or ineffective?), a bit of a sloppy construction in the statement
of this CFJ.  Fortunately, I do not have to deal with that issue, since
the POs referred to were clearly correct, and the second part of the
statement is false, making the whole false.

I therefore Judge this statement to be FALSE.

Judge Chuck's Evidence:

1. Rule 1893
2. Rule 1906
3. Message changing the Minimum Income (Some headers deleted)
4. Treasuror's report of budget subsequent to the change (Some headers
deleted)
5. Message issuing Minimum Income POs subsequent to the change (Some headers
   deleted)


Rule 1893/5 (Power=1)
The Treasuror's Budget

      The Treasuror's Budget shall include the following:

      (1) The Basic Officer Salary, an amount between 0 and 200 Stems.
      (2) The Salary of every officer that receives a monthly wage.
      (3) The Minimum Income.
      (4) The Speaker's Gratuity.
      (5) The Trade Fellowship amount for every Officers' Degree.
      (6) Any other material that is required by the rules to be in
          the Treasuror's budget.

      (2) - (4) above shall be given in integer multiples of 0.1, of
      the Basic Officer Salary, between 0 and 4 times the BOS
      inclusive.  (E.g. 3.2*The BOS).  Also, the average (mean) of
      all of the above shall be less than or equal to twice the BOS.

      If there is no valid version of the Treasuror's budget, there
      shall be a budget created as soon as possible by the Treasuror.
      This budget shall contain all the information that is required
      to be in the Treasuror's budget and shall be set, as best as is
      possible to the values of the previous quarter.  The resultant
      budget shall be considered to be the Treasuror's Budget.  The
      Treasuror shall post this budget to the public forum.
