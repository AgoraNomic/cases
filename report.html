     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3868">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3868</a>
     The above-quoted message created an Agoran proposal.

3867 Judged TRUE by Jason [Tue 21 Jul 2020]
     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3867">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3867</a>
     In the above message, I broke a pledge.

3865 Judged FALSE by Jason [Fri 10 Jul 2020]
     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3865">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3865</a>

     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3864">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3864</a>

     a bug.

     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3863">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3863</a>

     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3862">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3862</a>
     Facts (for example, 2 + 2 = 4), for the purposes of Agoran play,
     rely on some function of the collective Agoran opinion and not
     necessarily some objective reality. For example, if enough Agorans
     believe that 2 + 2 = 5 is true, it is then so for Agora.

     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3861">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3861</a>
     The above-quoted attempt to pay cards on nchâ€™s behalf was
     unsuccessful because attempting to pay 18 Victory Cards and/or 18
     Justice Cards in 4 sets of 4 is self-contradictory.
