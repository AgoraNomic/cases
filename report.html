OPEN CASES
---------------------------
3875 Assigned to G. [Due Fri 21 Aug 2020 18:35:40]
     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3875">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3875</a>

3874 Assigned to Gaelan [Due Fri 21 Aug 2020 18:34:34]
     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3874">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3874</a>
     If G. demonstrated a Rulebending Form with text {This statute
     takes precedence over all rules of power equal to this statute.
     This statute, not any rule, determines the relative precedence of
     rules and non-rule statutes in cases where they contradict. Rules
     to the contrary notwithstanding, ais523 hereby becomes a
     Rulebending Magister.}, this would be effective in making ais523 a
     Rulebending Magister.

     The "this message" in the disclaimer in evidence applies to the

     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3869">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3869</a>
     A player CAN send a message to agora-business by some method.

     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3868">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3868</a>
     The above-quoted message created an Agoran proposal.

     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3866">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3866</a>
     More than one Contracoli Contract exists right now.

3862 Judged IRRELEVANT by R. Lee [Fri 17 Jul 2020]
     <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3862">https://faculty.washington.edu/kerim/nomic/cases/?3862</a>
     Facts (for example, 2 + 2 = 4), for the purposes of Agoran play,
     rely on some function of the collective Agoran opinion and not
     necessarily some objective reality. For example, if enough Agorans
     believe that 2 + 2 = 5 is true, it is then so for Agora.
