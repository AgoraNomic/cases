Caller's Evidence:

As ADoP:

I resign from the Office of ADoP.  The Speaker (neil) thus becomes
holder of but not Electee to the Office of ADoP.


As GWotO:

The current Speaker is Tainted, and there is an Electee to the Office
of Speaker-Elect.  By Rule 1648, this triggers a Speaker Transition as
described in R402.

Notice of Speaker Transition:
  A Speaker Transition has begun.  At the commencement of the
  Transition, Steve held the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Assuming the particulars of the Notice are correct, Steve ceases to
hold the Office of Speaker-Elect and becomes the Speaker.


As ADoP:

Assuming the particulars of the above Notice are correct, Steve ceases
to hold the Office of Speaker-Elect.  E was not Electee to that
Office, so by Rule 1555, the Electee (that is to say, neil) becomes
holder of that Office.

Also, assuming Steve is Speaker, e must initiate an Election for ADoP
as soon as possible.


As a Player:

This makes CFJ 1331 more or less irrelevant; it was intended to
distinguish between two situations, and now both situations would
result in a decision of FALSE: either Steve stopped holding the Office
when I became Electee, or e stops holding the Office as of this
message.  I thus CFJ on the following statement:

Immediately after neil became Electee to the Office of Speaker-Elect
(at approximately 00:23:21 on 21 Nov 2001 GMT), Steve held the Office
of Speaker-Elect.

I bar Steve and Syllepsis from Judging this CFJ.


In addition, I would like to point out that I had no way of resigning
the Office of Speaker-Elect: R880 (Resignation of Offices) only allows
the holder of an Office to resign.  Also, should R1919 be interpreted
as saying that installing an Officer by Proposal makes the named
Player the Electee to, but not holder of, the Office?

Finally, perhaps there should be a Rule prohibiting the Speaker from
being GWotO?  Since the GWotO handles Speaker Transitions, e can
easily delay for a few weeks (possibly at the cost of Blots) eir
replacement as Speaker.  Sometimes this is for a good reason (such as
establishing who, precisely, holds the Office of Speaker-Elect), but
not always . . . .

========================================================================

Judge Crito's Arguments:

Here is the relevant sequence of events, as far as I have been able
to determine them.  (The dates below are based on my local time, by
the way, not GMT.)

1.  A Quarterly Speaker Transition occurred on 1 Oct 2001.  It was
correctly announced on 19 Oct 2001.  At this time, Solublefish became
Speaker and neil became temporary Speaker-Elect, based on the Order of
Succession laid out in R786.

2.  On 12 Nov 2001, Solublefish voluntarily resigned as Speaker, triggering
a Speaker Transition.  On the same date, neil nominates for the position of
Speaker-Elect.

3.  On 15 Nov 2001, a Notice of Transition was posted, causing neil to become
Speaker.  He was not Electee to Speaker-Elect at this time, so he is a
Tainted Speaker.  Since there is no S-E Electee at this time, the office is
filled based on the Order of Succession in R786.  At this point, neil held
both the Offices of Promotor and Registrar and so the S-E position fell to
Rulekeepor Michael.  At this point, he had not yet declined and was the
holder of that Office.

4.  On 20 Nov 2001, the nomination period for S-E ended with only neil as
nominee, who therefore wins that election.  Now we start to have fun.
R1555 states that the winner of an election immediately becomes Electee and
holder of the Office.  However, R1647 claims precedence and declares that
the Speaker can never hold the Office of S-E.  It does not, however, prevent
him from becoming Electee.  Therefore, at this point in time, neil becomes the
Electee to the Office of Speaker-Elect, but the last holder of that Office
is Michael, not Steve.  Because there is now an Electee to S-E and neil is
Tainted, a new Speaker Transition commences at this point.

5.  On 21 Nov 2001, Murphy publicly declines to be S-E and on 22 Nov 2001,
Michael publicly declines to be S-E.  Both of these statements are ineffective
because at the time they were issued there was an Electee to the Office of
Speaker-Elect.  The Order of Succession rules are only invoked when there is
no Electee.

Therefore, in the period immediately following the S-E nomination period,
Michael was temporary Speaker-Elect, not Steve.  This would be true even
if Michael's declination of that Office had been effective.  Therefore,
I think the judgement of FALSE is warranted.
