Caller's Arguments:

twg deputised for the Prime Minister and it was not noted as a
temporary deputisation, therefore e became Prime Minister. However, e
also made emself Speaker. One of these was not possible, according to
R2472, which states, "Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a player
CANNOT be installed into an office if doing so would make em
Overpowered." However, if one of these wasn't possible, then the other
was. This seems to create a paradox.

However, R103 says:
     If the Prime Minister is emself Laureled, eir power to appoint a
     Speaker continues for the entirety of a message in which e resigns as
     Prime Minister, and if e is the only Laureled player, e CAN void that
     power, and thereby discharge the obligation to use it, by announcing
     that e declines to take the office.

This is interesting because it doesn't specify that the Prime Minister
must end the message out of the office, so it is possible that this
message qualified since it included a resignation from the Prime
Minister.

Judge Alexis's Arguments:

R2160 is quite clear in excluding its own application ("other than by
deputisation"). I don't see how the plain meaning of the text of the
rules can have any other reasonable interpretation. R2160 only looks
at whether the player could, in its hypothetical, perform the action
or not. It does not care why. In the hypothetical where twg was also
PM, e could not appoint emself Speaker by R2472. Therefore e cannot
deputise to do it.
