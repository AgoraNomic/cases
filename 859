The abovementioned sentences of Rule 1600 read as follows:
      Except where the Rules explicitly state otherwise, any
      mathematical term in the Rules shall be construed to have the
      definition usually given to it in standard mathematics.  In
      particular,  "number" shall mean  "real number."

To me, this seems trivially true: the passage doesn't apply to rules
which (re)define the mathematical terms used; for the others, then, we
are told to use the standard definitions.  And, in my experience, that's
exactly the way we've always done it: if the rules don't define a word,
use the RL definition of it.

Thus, I judge CFJ 859 TRUE.  (And magically, Rule 1600 goes *poof* and
disappears.  Glad I recorded it for posterity within my arguments. :)
