==============================  CFJ 1616  ==============================

    Zefram is a person.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 G.
Barred:                                 Zefram

Judge:                                  Sherlock
Judgement:                              TRUE

========================================================================

History:

Called by G.:                           02 Feb 2007 17:34:51 GMT
Assigned to Sherlock:                   21 Feb 2007 18:10:52 GMT
Judged TRUE by Sherlock:                28 Feb 2007 19:58:19 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

I, for one, never implied that pineapple-ness, etc. was exclusive
of being a person.  However, in the message quoted below, Zefram implies
(by switching back to being a human) that e believed that, in deeming emself
to be an avocado, e was deeming emself to not be a person.

E also implied, by quoting a message about agreements, that e was
doing so as a binding agreement.

Therefore, by agreeing to be an avocado, e was consenting to not be considered
a person as a matter of Agoran law. In doing so, e lost the right to call a
CFJ (R101), and for that matter, to do what e wilt, so e lost the right to
make emself back into a person.

(By the way, e may be a player but not a person, registration makes
sure only people register, but when a person becomes a non-person
while registered, e remains a player...right?)

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 101/4 (Power=3)
Agoran Rights and Privileges

      The rules may define persons as possessing specific rights or
      privileges.  Be it hereby proclaimed that no binding agreement
      or interpretation of Agoran law may abridge, reduce, limit, or
      remove a person's defined rights.  A person's defined privileges
      are assumed to exist in the absense of an explicit, binding
      agreement to the contrary.  This rule takes precedence over any
      rule which would allow restrictions of a person's rights or
      privileges.

         i. Every person has the privilege of doing what e wilt.

        ii. Every player has the right to perform an action which is
            not regulated.

       iii. Every person has the right to invoke judgement, appeal a
            judgement, and to initiate an appeal on a sentencing or
            judicial order binding em.

        iv. Every person has the right to refuse to become party to
            a binding agreement.  The absense of a person's explicit,
            willful consent shall be considered a refusal.

         v. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
            an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, which e has
            not had the reasonable opportunity to review.

        vi. Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

       vii. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
            once for any single action or inaction.

      viii. Every player besides the Speaker has the right to
            deregister rather than continue to play.

      Please treat Agora right good forever.

So if I did agree to such deeming, would it be effective?

I hereby deem myself to be an avocado.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the statement "Zefram is an avocado".

I hereby deem myself to be a human.

Judge Sherlock's Arguments:

A picture of emself Zefram did refer,
In countenance e resembles not Aaron Burr,
But definitely of human construe,
And therefore I must judge TRUE,
For eir personhood it did verily ensure!
