Caller's Arguments:

A:
{
      A player whose master is not emself is a zombie (syn. inactive);
      all other players are active.  A zombie's master, if another
      player, is allowed to act on behalf of the zombie (i.e. as the
      zombie's agent), except a master CANNOT act on behalf of a zombie
      to:
        - initiate, support, object to, or perform a dependent action;
        - act on behalf of that zombie's zombies;
        - bid in a zombie auction;
        - enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;
        - initiate a Call for Judgement;
        - deregister.
}

B:
{
      A player whose master is not emself is a zombie (syn. inactive);
      all other players are active.  A zombie's master, if another
      player, is allowed to act on behalf of the zombie (i.e. as the
      zombie's agent), except a master CANNOT act on behalf of a zombie
      to:

        - initiate, support, object to, or perform a dependent action;
        - act on behalf of that zombie's zombies;
        - bid in a zombie auction;
        - enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;
        - initiate a Call for Judgement;
        - deregister.
}

C:
{
      A player whose master is not emself is a zombie (syn. inactive);
      all other players are active.  A zombie's master, if another
      player, is allowed to act on behalf of the zombie (i.e. as the
      zombie's agent), except a master CANNOT act on behalf of a zombie
      to:

        - act on behalf of that zombie's zombies;

        - bid in a zombie auction;

        - enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;

B is the same as A with a newline added before the first bullet.

Judge omd's Arguments:

CFJ 3452 ruled that paragraph boundaries should be determined based mainly 
on grammatical structure rather than layout.  Following its reasoning, "A" 
above would all be considered a single paragraph, since it's a single 
grammatical sentence; therefore, there are no "paragraph breaks" to 
contend with and the changes are definitely insignificant.

That isn't the interpretation I would have chosen, but it's a reasonable
interpretation, so Rule 217 effectively requires me to follow it.

But it doesn't matter.  Even if the bullets were paragraphs, I find that 
Rule 2429 does not make any and all whitespace between paragraphs sacred.  
The rule text states that changing whitespace is "generally 
insignificant", i.e. insignificant in most cases, "except for paragraph 
breaks".  From that we can infer that changing paragraph breaks is not 
insignificant in *most* cases, but it can still be insignificant in some 
cases.  Common sense suggests that we interpret this as a prohibition on 
merging or splitting paragraphs â€“ in other words, changing a "paragraph 
break" to a less significant sort of whitespace, or vice versa.

After all, the intent of the exception is to prevent whitespace changes 
that could affect meaning.  Changing the amount or type of whitespace 
between paragraphs wouldn't usually affect meaning.  But merging or 
splitting paragraphs could, because several rules refer to parts of 
themselves using either the word "paragraph" itself, or the words "above" 
and/or "below" (where merging paragraphs could change what text is above 
or below).

CFJs 3777 and 3778 are TRUE.
