I'm afraid it's a bit unclear whether this worked. Submitting
proposals is governed by Rule 2350. There's specific information that
needs to be specified when you create a proposal. A lot of it is
optional, but the one thing that's absolutely essential is the text.
Here, it's unclear where the text of the proposal begins and ends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Murphy's Arguments (prior to reconsideration):

The rules actually say "clearly specify" at one other point (Rule 107,
Initiating Agoran Decisions). In this case, while "exactly which part of
this message constitutes the text of the intended proposal" is somewhat
unclear, it isn't substantially unclear; any reasonable interpretation
still leads to a proposal that, if adopted, would attempt to create a
rule. (Though that would bring up a similar question of whether
"Onboarding of Newly Activated Players" should be interpreted as that
rule's title, or part of its body text.)

TRUE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge R. Lee's Arguments (prior to moot):

D. Wet attempted to create a proposal in an unorthodox manner. Eir message
is quoted below.

The question is whether this message is a proposal. A proposal CAN be
created by announcement, specifying its text (a proposal is a body of
text). Per rule 2350 other attributes may be specified as well, but these
are irrelevant here.

Usually text would be specified with quotation marks, brackets or the like.
Nonetheless, the words that are meant to be proposal text are clear to me
here. The message begins "I propose to", which are action words that
effectuate the requirement to announce. The rest of it is text that is
clearly meant to be proposal text ('create a new rule...') as they would
only have function inside a proposal. The process of 'specifying' proposal
text just needs to clearly distinguish text that's inside the proposal from
text that's outside of it. In this case the words "I propose to" are
clearly separated from the rest of the message's text not by formatting or
punctuation but by the purpose they serve. These words serve the functional
purpose of announcing the proposal while the other text only makes sense as
proposal text (this is clear to any reasonable Agoran reader).

'Specify' and 'clearly specify' are synonyms, as a specification will make
clear exactly what text is meant to be proposal text. If this is clear,
then obviously text is both specified and clearly specified.

I judge CFJ 3922 TRUE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge R. Lee's arguments (upon remand):

D. Wet attempted to submit a proposal with the words "I propose to create a
new rule....". Previously, I found that this unambiguously created a
proposal with the text following the word 'to'. A majority of Agorans voted
to send the case back to me.

A proposal must mandatorily 'specify' its text (R 2350). An ambiguous text
is not specific, so by definition it is not specified. About half of
Agorans take one interpretation of this text while half take the other
interpretation, which is very powerful evidence that the text is deeply
ambiguous. Because this is so, D. Wet failed to create a proposal.

It must be said that even if half of agorans took a certain interpretation,
I would still reject that interpretation if it was completely unreasonable.
There have been and will be occasions where many agorans fail to act
reasonably, and judges are not hostage to public opinion. Nonetheless, I
think it is perfectly reasonable to be confused about where, if anywhere,
the proposal's actual text begins here.

I judge CFJ 3922 FALSE.
