========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

R2125 reads, in part:

      An action is regulated if:

      [...]

        d) The rules explicitly state that it MAY be performed while
           certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action MAY NOT
           be performed except as allowed by the rules.

R101 reads, in part:

        ii. Every player has the right to perform an action which is
            not regulated.

Thus, R101 indicates that any action MAY be performed while the
condition of the action not being regulated is satisfied.  This meets
the criteria of R2125(d), which therefore defines the action as
regulated.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 2125 (Power=3)

      An action is regulated if:

        a) It is IMPOSSIBLE.

        b) It is ILLEGAL.

        c) The rules explicitly state that it CAN be performed while
           certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action CANNOT
           be performed except as allowed by the rules.

        d) The rules explicitly state that it MAY be performed while
           certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action MAY NOT
           be performed except as allowed by the rules.

        e) It would, as part of its effect, modify information for
           which some player is required to be a recordkeepor.  Such
           an action CANNOT modify that information except as allowed
           by the rules.

        f) A judicial finding has determined that it is regulated,
           and has not been superseded by subsequent legislation.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by woggle:

R101(ii) says that it 'may' be performed not that it 'MAY' be
performed. This could be a material difference.

The judge should also consider whether reading R2125(d) this way would
be barred by R101(ii) taking precedence over R2125(d). (Can one read
into R101(ii) that there must exist unregulated actions? Or even
something stronger, like that the rules are inherently limited to
controlling aspects relevant to the game?)

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Machiavelli:

CFJ 1989 asks if:

>    All actions are regulated.

The caller provides the following evidence:

Assuming it hasn't been changed recently (I don't remember any
proposals to change it), the first paragraph of R101 states, "Be it
hereby proclaimed that no binding agreement or interpretation of
Agoran law may abridge, reduce, limit, or remove a person's defined
rights." What it does not say is that every person MAY perform an
action which e has the right to perform. An important phrase in
R2125(d) is "explicitly state". R101 doesn't use the word "MAY" (it
does use the word "may", but only in stating that no agreement or law
"may" limit rights, not that persons "may" invoke them), so it doesn't
explicitly state anything. Therefore, FALSE.

In addition, R2125 mentions "that [an action] MAY be performed while
certain conditions are satisfied". Interpreting "every player has the
right to perform an action which is not regulated" as "any action MAY
be performed while that action is not regulated" is a stretch,
especially since "that action is not regulated" makes no sense outside
the context of "any action MAY be performed"; a more natural
interpretation would be simply "any action that is not regulated MAY
be performed", which R2125 doesn't apply to at all.

On the other hand, a statement such as "a player's posture MAY be
flipped to Sitting while an Emergency Session is not in progress" (not
that that statement appears in the rules anywhere) cannot be
refactored so as not to include the "while", and "an Emergency Session
is not in progress" does make sense outside of the context of this
MAY. R2125 deals with cases like the latter, not like the former;
therefore, FALSE.

Now I mention woggle's arguments:

> The judge should also consider whether reading R2125(d) this way would
> be barred by R101(ii) taking precedence over R2125(d). (Can one read

I don't see how "every player has the right to perform an action which
is not regulated" could take precedence over "X is regulated" for any
X, as the former doesn't state that any action is not regulated. There
is the fact that there would be no reason to mention unregulated
actions unless unregulated actions exist, but when that clause was
added to R101, this case certainly hadn't been called and argued, so I
consider this weak evidence of FALSE at best. That the rules are
inherently limited to controlling aspects relevant to the game is what
I'd say is not that good an interpretation of R101, but a plenty good
statement of truth.

All this given, I (intend to) judge FALSE.
