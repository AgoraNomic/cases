Caller's Arguments:

A player who holds power of attorney for another player may generally
perform actions on behalf of that player.  Provision (f) of rule 1841
(Granting Power of Attorney) attempts to prevent the holder from
deregistering the grantor.  However, rule 101, the power of which
exceeds that of rule 1841, explicitly states that a player may always
deregister.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

1.  Rule 101/1 (Obey the Rules)
2.  Rule 1841/6 (Granting Power of Attorney)

1.

Rule 101/1 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in
      effect, in the form in which they are currently in effect.
      However, a Player besides the Speaker may always deregister
      rather than continue to play.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
      permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permit it.  Any change to the game state which would
      make it impossible to make arbitrary modifications to the Rules
      by any combination of actions by Players does not occur, any
      Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of
      the first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
      (Immutable) and 201-219 (Mutable).

Rule 1841/6 (Power=1)
Granting Power of Attorney

      (a) A Player (the Grantor) who has been continuously registered
          for more than two months is empowered to give eir Power of
          Attorney (PoA) to another Player (the Holder), as specified
          in this Rule.

      (b) The Holder holds the Grantor's PoA if all of the following
          conditions are met:
          (1) the Grantor has announced that e grants eir PoA to the
              Holder;
          (2) the Holder has, in the week immediately preceding or
              immediately following the Grantor's announcement,
              publically consented to hold the Grantor's PoA;
          (3) the Holder is Active; and
          (4) the grant of PoA has not been withdrawn for any of the
              reasons listed in (d).

      (c) The grant of PoA commences at the time the Grantor grants
          eir PoA to the Holder, or at the time the Holder consents to
          the grant, or at the time specified by the Grantor,
          whichever is latest. If the Grantor specifies a time at
          which the grant of PoA is to commence, it must be a time no
          more than seven days from the Grantor's announcement. Later
          specifications are without effect for the purposes of this
          Rule.

      (d) The grant of PoA is withdrawn if:
          (1) the period of the grant specified by the Grantor
              expires;
          (2) the Grantor publically withdraws the grant;
          (3) the Grantor is deregistered;
          (4) the Holder ceases to be active or is deregistered; or
          (5) the Holder has held the PoA continuously for three
              months.

      (e) Nothing in this Rule shall be construed as preventing other
          Rules from granting and withdrawing PoA by other means.

      (f) Other Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player who
          has granted PoA to another Player as described in this rule
          shall be deregistered while the grant of PoA is in effect.

========================================================================

Judge G.'s Arguments:

R1841.f states "Other Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no
Player who has granted PoA to another Player as described in this rule shall
be deregistered while the grant of PoA is in effect."

Firstly, this Court finds that the above clause conflicts with a Grantor's
R101 (Power-3) privilege to deregister, and as R101 has higher precedence, the
Grantor may always deregister emself while a grant of PoA is in effect
[R1482].

Secondly, this Court finds that R1841.f WOULD prevent "externally" induced
deregistration mandated by other power-1 Rules, e.g. lawlessness, as R1841.f
successfully claims precedence over other power-1 Rules on the subject of
deregistration [R1030].

But does a Holder of a PoA's attempt to deregister the Grantor fall into the
first or the second case above?  Does granting PoA transfer the R101 privilege
of deregistration, or does R1841.f prevent this grant?

The definition of PoA (R1842) states that the Holder is the Prime Executor of
the Grantor, and the definition of Prime Executor (R1989) states that by
default, a Prime Executor is the executor of an entity for all actions, and
this would include the R101 deregistration privilege.  But R1989 specifically
qualifies Prime Executorship as follows:

      (c) If the Rules designate a Player to be the Prime Executor of
          an entity, without specifying particular actions that the
          Prime Executor is responsible for performing, then that
          Player is the Prime Executor of that entity with respect to
          all actions that the entity is required to perform.

This Court finds it implicit in R1989.c that the rules can specify actions
that a Prime Executor is NOT responsible for; that is, the Rules may
successfully state "The Holder is the Prime Executor for the Grantor with
respect to all actions execept X", or Rule A may state "The Holder is the
Prime Executor for the Grantor [with respect to all actions]" and Rule B may
state "but not for action X".  In this latter case, Rule B would be a
successful limitation if it had precedence over Rule A.

Since R1841.f has a higher precedence than either the definition of PoA or the
definitions of Prime Executors (R1842, R1989), it is consistent with the above
argument that R1841.f succeeds in refusing the Holder the grant of Prime
Executorship for the purpose of deregistrating the Grantor.

This Court finds FALSE, the holder of a PoA may not deregister the grantor.

========================================================================

Judge G.'s Evidence:

Rule 1482/1 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.


Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.


Rule 1841/6 (Power=1)
Granting Power of Attorney

      (a) A Player (the Grantor) who has been continuously registered
          for more than two months is empowered to give eir Power of
          Attorney (PoA) to another Player (the Holder), as specified
          in this Rule.

      (b) The Holder holds the Grantor's PoA if all of the following
          conditions are met:
          (1) the Grantor has announced that e grants eir PoA to the
              Holder;
          (2) the Holder has, in the week immediately preceding or
              immediately following the Grantor's announcement,
              publically consented to hold the Grantor's PoA;
          (3) the Holder is Active; and
          (4) the grant of PoA has not been withdrawn for any of the
              reasons listed in (d).

      (c) The grant of PoA commences at the time the Grantor grants
          eir PoA to the Holder, or at the time the Holder consents to
          the grant, or at the time specified by the Grantor,
          whichever is latest. If the Grantor specifies a time at
          which the grant of PoA is to commence, it must be a time no
          more than seven days from the Grantor's announcement. Later
          specifications are without effect for the purposes of this
          Rule.

      (d) The grant of PoA is withdrawn if:
          (1) the period of the grant specified by the Grantor
              expires;
          (2) the Grantor publically withdraws the grant;
          (3) the Grantor is deregistered;
          (4) the Holder ceases to be active or is deregistered; or
          (5) the Holder has held the PoA continuously for three
              months.

      (e) Nothing in this Rule shall be construed as preventing other
          Rules from granting and withdrawing PoA by other means.

      (f) Other Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player who
          has granted PoA to another Player as described in this rule
          shall be deregistered while the grant of PoA is in effect.


Rule 1989/1 (Power=1)
Prime Executors

      (a) The Prime Executor of an entity with respect to a certain
          action is the Player who is responsible for performing that
          action. For each action that an entity is required to
          perform, there shall be at most one Prime Executor of that
          entity with respect to that action. Any penalty incurred due
          to an entity's failure to perform as required by the Rules
          is incurred by the Prime Executor of that entity.

      (b) Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the Prime
          Executor of an entity with respect to a certain action must
          be an Executor of that entity, or a Limited Executor of that
          entity who is permitted to perform that action on behalf of
          that entity.

      (c) If the Rules designate a Player to be the Prime Executor of
          an entity, without specifying particular actions that the
          Prime Executor is responsible for performing, then that
          Player is the Prime Executor of that entity with respect to
          all actions that the entity is required to perform.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, each Player is eir
          own Prime Executor.

      (e) If a Player is the sole Executor of an entity, then e is the
          Prime Executor of that entity. This provision does not apply
          to a Player who is the sole Limited Executor, but not the
          Executor, of an entity.
