Caller's Arguments:

The action in question only became illegal about 20 minutes
(if I recall correctly) after it was performed. Therefore NOT GUILTY,
and my Rest should be destroyed.

========================================================================

Judge Yally's Arguments:

> > H. Defendant coppro, which proposal was it that made that action illegal?
>
> It was distributed the subsequent week as proposal 6238.

Perhaps I'm missing something here, but you clearly indicated that the
proposal pool was empty when you distributed 6226 - 6236. In fact, it was
not, and contained the proposal Judicial Sanctions. Even though you were not
required to distribute it at that time, you were still required, as a part
of your weekly duties, to indicate the state of the proposal pool. I
therefore opine GUILTY and sentence APOLOGY with no prescribed words. I
destroy 1 rest in the possession of coppro as a result of the relevant NoV.
If I have missed some important detail, please appeal and remand, providing
any evidence I have overlooked.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by scshunt:

Promotor is, and shall always be, my friend... er... one of the hardest
jobs in Agora. Slips are common and everyone makes them. But officers,
including myself, need to be very prudent that their mistakes do not
overly harm Agora, and the broken window principle provides that leaving
the smallest mistakes unfixed can lead to massive damage occurring
quickly. This is both a psychological effect, in that officers do not
endeavor to correct their mistakes because they go unpunished, and so
the integrity of the reports becomes compromised, and an actual one, in
that the lack of complete information about the game state at any given
point in time leads subsequently to the further divergence of the
gamestate from the actual state. While there exist rules to provide
solutions for this, as in the recent discoveries with regards to
precedence between rules and with regards to elections, it is far better
to avoid the incorrect information in the first place. As a result, I
deeply apologize for my negligence in failing to publish an accurate
report of the Proposal Pool, and I hope that in the future, I will have
more successful endeavors in the offices I currently hold and will hold
in the future.
