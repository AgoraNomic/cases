|Futuremyartug is a (as yet) undefined entity from a point in time in

|Futuremyartug registers. I would make an effort at describing what
|Futuremyartug is, but quite frankly it is beyond your comprehension

Gratuitous Arguments by BobTHJ:

Futuremyartug was clearly not to be taken serious. It's announcement
was intended for humorous purposes only and clearly not meant to
actually register a player. Despite the fact that the text of a
statement may advocate a certain point of view, when clearly expressed
through sarcasm there is little question that the author does not
actually advocate that point of view.

========================================================================

Judge Taral's Arguments:

Regardless of the sarcastic intent, Rule 2149 is worded quite
strictly. It does not refer to "lying" or any other intentional
misdirection. It says simply "unless e believes ... e is telling the
truth". Your defense, in a peculiar way, convicts you.

I judge GUILTY, and prescribe a sentence of APOLOGY, with prescribed
words as follows:

lies
damnation
sarcasm
intent
misdirection

========================================================================

Appellant BobTHJ's Arguments:

I appeal this decision. My intent was clear, and though R2149 may
prohibit this form of sarcasm the rules in this case have led to my
damnation. While I do not advocate lies and misdirection as a means of
equitable play, it should be clear by now that I am not above bribery
as a useful tool to obtain a desired outcome. Therefore I post the
following per the Vote Market agreement:

Buy Ticket
Action: Be a member of an appeals panel that submits a decision of
OVERRULE to UNAWARE in the appeal of CFJ 1849.
Cost: 3VP

As an argument for my appeal I suggest that due to not carefully
reading the rules, I was blissfully unaware that my sarcastic
registration of Futuremyartug was in violation of R2149.

Should the appeals panel not overturn this judgment this message shall
serve as my apology.
