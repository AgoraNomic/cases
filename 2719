==============================  CFJ 2719  ==============================

    If judged to be UNDECIDABLE, the CFJ initiated in the quoted text
    would be a tortoise.

Caller's Arguments:

Can this be construed as arising out of the CFJ itself? I
think so, as it is very similar to the way by which "This statement is
FALSE." would be dealt with - judged UNDECIDABLE, but since the paradox
arises out of the CFJ, it's not a tortoise.

Gratuitous Arguments by Pavitra:

Rule 2110 reads, in part:
      A tortoise is an inquiry case on the possibility or legality of
      a rule-defined action (actual or hypothetical, but not arising
      from that case itself, and not occurring after the initiation of
      that case) for which the question of veracity is UNDECIDABLE.

The action whose legality is in question is certainly "occurring after
the initiation of that case". FALSE.

========================================================================

Judge Tiger's Arguments:

The relevant part of R2110, quoted in Pavitra's argument, takes the
form of a "not a and not b". Neither a or b is true. The question of
legality does arise from the CFJ, and the hypothetical action whose
legality is in question does occur after the initiation of the case.
