Caller's Arguments:

The Constitution text (as text in and of itself) is not explicit as to
the definition of "nomic namespace".  It was uncoverable with a fairly
trivial search but that is not sufficient for published legal matters
here; therefore any definitions not explicit in the Constitution as
published defer to Agoran definitions, not elsewhere-posted OmNom
definitions, and default to Agora-published versions of any reports.

In particular, this link (http://omnom.wikidot.com/nomic:players)
lists 441344 as a player, but that information has not been published
in Agora, therefore under Agoran interpretation, this constitution text
refers to a blank (i.e. unstarted) nomic without players or gamestate
beyond what is published.  (Note: in calling this CFJ I am calling
attention to an alleged report, not publishing its content myself, so
I disclaim specific knowledge of its veracity in this publication).

I should note that I think that the appropriate solution is to publish,
in the registration intent, a constitution text that includes some
explicit linkages along with explicit publication of the current
gamestate, not to require all such nomics to require all such reports
in Agora all the time.

Just in case this is unclear even given the message context, I publish
the above as a report as defined by the published OmNom Constitution.

Judge omd's Arguments:

Unlike previous contract rules, Rule 2328 doesn't require any kind of
submission to Agoran governance, but simply refers to "an agreement".
Therefore there is no special reason to require that such agreements
act 'natively' rather than 'foreignly', and in this case the agreement
is clearly intended to use foreign or ordinary language definitions of
terms rather than Agoran ones.

However, the caller's arguments suggest that Machiavelli has not
adequately identified the agreement the OmNom Constitution is the text
of, so eir attempts to register it failed due to ambiguity.

Also, the precedent of CFJ 1772 suggests that neither the OmNom
Constitution nor (despite recent rulemaking) Agora is actually an
"agreement" in the Agoran sense, so the text as published cannot
become a player.  I hereby deregister Agora.

UNDETERMINED, too vague as there appear to currently be two games
whose ruleset is the published OmNom constitution (one is G.'s).
