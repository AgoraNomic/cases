Assigned to OscarMeyr:                  06 Apr 2004 03:25:14 GMT
Judged FALSE by OscarMeyr:              11 Apr 2004 14:09:11 GMT

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

A CFJ indicates a dispute (of any type, great or small) in Agora, as
defined by R991.  It is handled according to the well-established Agoran
Judgement system.

Under R1941, a challenge to an expenditure of Kudos is handled by the
Herald, as a query whether the indicated Player had enough Kudos to
support the challenged expenditure.

I see sufficient clear differences between a CFJ and a challenge
regarding Kudos to rule that the two acts are completely separate:
  1.  A CFJ is handled by a Trial Judge, who may be any Player; a
challenge regarding Kudos is handled only by the Herald.
  2.  A CFJ may be escalated to an Appelate Court; a challenge regarding
Kudos may be escalatable to a CFJ.  A CFJ cannot be downgraded to a
challenge regarding Kudos.
  3.  A CFJ may address any type of dispute; a challenge regarding Kudos
addresses one specific question, as I noted above.

Therefore, I find that a CFJ is of a completely different nature than a
challenge over an expenditure of Kudos.  Accordingly, I Judge this CFJ
as FALSE.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Evidence:

Rule 991/5 (Power=2)
Invoking Judgement

      Any person may request formal resolution of a dispute pertaining
      to this Nomic by submitting a Call for Judgement (CFJ) to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The submission of a CFJ constitutes proof
      of the existence of such a dispute.

      A CFJ should be a single clearly-labeled Statement whose truth
      or falsity can be determined using logical reasoning, assuming
      perfect knowledge.  A CFJ may be accompanied by Arguments,
      Evidence, or other related material; the Judge is encouraged,
      but not required, to take notice of these things.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall publish the text of a CFJ, along
      with any additional material submitted by the Caller (including
      but not limited to Arguments and Evidence), no later than the
      time e announces the identity of the first Judge assigned to
      that CFJ.


Rule 1941/2 (Power=1) (IN PART)
Fees

      Any Player (hereafter the challenger) may announce that the
      Actor possessed insufficient Honor (kudos) to perform the
      action, provided e issues eir challenge within 7 days of the
      attempted action.

      As soon as possible after such a challenge, the Herald shall
      confirm or deny whether the Actor possessed kudos equal to or
      greater than the fee at the time e attempted the action.  If the
      Actor in fact possessed insufficient honor, or the honor of the
      Actor cannot be determined by reasonable effort, the action
      shall be deemed to have not occurred and the kudos of the Actor
      (and Agora) shall be deemed to have not been changed by the fee.

      If a Player issues a challenge as above, but more than 7 days
      have passed since the attempted action, then the action shall be
      permitted to stand.  As soon as possible after a late challenge
      is issued, the Herald shall confirm or deny its correctness.
      But in this case the Fee shall be recorded even if the Actor is
      left with negative kudos.
