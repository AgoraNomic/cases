========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1561 states that if a proposal offers a bribe to other players it
shall not take effect.  I argue that a rule change is proposed to
either improve the game for all players or at the very least for the
player submitting the proposal.  Thus any proposal with a rule change
in it is bribing either all players to vote for it to improve whatever
aspect of the game the rule change attempts to change, or at the very
least is bribing the proposer himself to vote FOR the proposal.  The
basic premiss of proposing a proposal with a rule change is to
persuade other players to vote FOR your proposed rule change.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Webster defines bribe as the following:  Something serving to
influence or persuade.

Rule 754/5 (Power=3)
Freedom of Communication

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (1) No Player shall be prohibited from participating in the
          Fora.

      (2) No Player shall be punished for accurately quoting a Rule,
          Proposal, Statement, Judgement, another Player, or another
          reference.

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (3) A difference in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the use of
          a synonym or abbreviation in place of a word or phrase, is
          inconsequential in all forms of communication, as long as
          the difference does not create an ambiguity in meaning.

      (4) A term explicitly defined by the Rules shall be interpreted
          as having that meaning, as shall its ordinary-language
          synonyms not explicitly defined by the rules.  In
          particular, the term "number" shall be interpreted as "real
          number".

      (5) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, shall
          be interpreted as having the meaning it has in those
          contexts.

      (6) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          shall be interpreted as having its ordinary-language
          meaning.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules which dictate
      terminology or grammar.

Rule 1561/1 (Power=2)
Illegality of Bonus Clauses

      Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players to
      vote either FOR or AGAINST a Proposal (either itself or another
      Proposal) shall be completely without effect, even if it is
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

========================================================================

Judge Sherlock's Arguments:

All sorts of proposals are "submitted" in Agora.  Some are kept in the
Pool and distributed and others are retracted by their owners.  Some fail
and some succeed in the voting process.  What proposals are being referred
to by this statement -- those that have been distributed and passed?  If
that was the Caller's intention, e should have written:

 "Proposals containing rule changes that were passed after..."

Since there have been countless Proposals submitted that were never passed
for whatever reason, I don't think it can fairly be said that
"Proposals... submitted... have taken effect."  There needs to be more
specificity for the Caller's statement to be true.
