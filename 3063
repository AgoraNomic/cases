Caller's Arguments:

The "with notice" should have taken care of the R101 objection underlying
the CFJ3034 judgement, when the second attempt was made (see Evidence).

ais523's gratuitous arguments in CFJ3034 have yet to be answered.  As a
counterargument to ais523, I'll note that the R105 "when permitted by other
rules" is satisfied by the fact that the Rules state that the President CAN
take actions, which makes any such actions POSSIBLE unless prohibited (and
instruments of sufficient power are not prohibited from changing the rules).

Note that in R105 the "when permitted" clause is a particularly weak type of
permission, not being "explicit" and being next to the "instrument generally
CAN" clause.  Together, this implies that if the Rules say that an Instrument
CAN take an action generally unless prohibited, that is sufficient permission
for R105; the protections to rule changes come from R1688 and R2140
preventing entities from becoming instruments in the first place.

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

Also, it's important to note that the rules don't give Proposals any more
permission than they give the president; R106 says that Proposals can and do
make changes in general and provide a mechanism (just as the president can
take actions in general by way of a different mechanism) and relies on the
fact that instruments are not further prohibited from making actual rule
changes, so can do so.

So if the President can't, then neither can Proposals.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

CFJ 2213 is highly relevant.  I misremembered the
precedent as stating that making rule changes is not an "action", but
in fact it's the exact opposite.

However, I still disagree: Rule 103 (or 2326) does not allow the
President to take arbitrary actions, in the sense of "any gamestate
change that can be written as one".  Even without Presidential Power,
that includes control over any number of gamestate quantities; the
President was supposed to be a virtual player, not a god.  R103
explicitly does not make POSSIBLE any otherwise IMPOSSIBLE action:

      The Speaker CAN, by announcement, cause the President to take
      actions that are not otherwise IMPOSSIBLE, except for
      deregistration.

Arguably this still applies because Rule 2326 makes it POSSIBLE for
the President to take arbitrary actions in general:

      A first-class Player CAN cause the President to take actions
      Without Objection, or with Agoran Consent.

but, as above, I think the implication is "actions that the President CAN
take".

========================================================================

Judge Walker's Arguments:

Rule 105 states:

     Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
     as part of its effect,

     (rule changes)

So it's clear that for the President must receive permission from some
other rule in order to be able to make rule changes. The relevant
clause is:

     The Speaker CAN, by announcement, cause the President to take
     actions that are not otherwise IMPOSSIBLE,

In other words, the Speaker CAN cause the President to take actions
that are otherwise POSSIBLE - made possible by other rules. Unlike
proposals, which have R2350 (Except as prohibited by other rules, a
proposal that takes effect CAN, as part of its effect, apply the
changes that it specifies) the President has no such clause allowing
to make changes in such a general way. I judge FALSE.
