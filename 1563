Rule 2076/0 (Power=1)
Card cards

       Caption:  Your Turn
       Elements: Budgeted
       Exploit:  A Player you name must play or discard a card in the
                 next 72 hours, or commit the Class-1 Infraction of
                 Delay of Game, reportable by you.

       Caption:  Discard Picking
       Elements: Budgeted, Delayed[4]
       Exploit:  If a copy of a card was played or discarded in the
                 past 72 hours, you may name it, and a copy of that
                 card, if one is still in the deck, is automatically
                 transferred from the Deck to your hand.

Proposal 4678 by Goethe, AI=1, Ordinary
Taking over Takeovers


Proposal: Taking over Takeovers

Amend Rule 2070 [Card Powez] by inserting after this paragraph:
       * Delayed[N]: You may not play this card if you have played a
         copy of this card in the past N times 24 hours.
the following paragraph:
       * Asleep[N]: No one may play a copy of this card if anyone
         has played a copy of this card in the past N times 24
         hours.

Amend Rule 2078 (Corporate Takeovers) to read:

       Initiative is a stuck player switch, tracked by the Assessor,
       with values Gote and Sente.

       Mainsail is a stuck proposal switch, tracked by the Assessor,
       with values Tyrannical and Piratical.  When a Proposal's
       Mainsail is flipped to Piratical, it becomes democratic and
       sane.

       A Minimal Crew is defined as the number of active noisy
       players divided by 3.

       If a Proposal has a Piratical Mainsail at the end of its
       voting period, and at that time specifies a set of Players
       (the Raiders) in number neither less than a minimal crew nor
       greater than twice a minimal crew, then:
         (a) If the proposal is adopted, then all Raiders are
             flipped to Sente, and all other players are flipped to
             Gote.
         (b) Otherwise, all Raiders are flipped to Gote, and all
             other players are flipped to Sente.

       The following cards are defined:
          * Caption:  Hoist the Flag
            Quota:    5
            Elements: Asleep[30]
            Exploit:  You may flip the Mainsail of any one Proposal
                      to Piratical.

          * Caption:  Royal Navy
            Quota:    2
            Elements: None
            Exploit:  You may flip the Mainsail of any one Proposal
                      to Tyrannical.

          * Caption:  Cannon Fire
            Quota:    3
            Elements: None
            Exploit:  You may abort a Piratical Proposal.  A copy of
                      the Proposal is added to the Proposal Pool with
                      its characteristics intact.

          * Caption:  Dread Pirate Roberts
            Quota:    3
            Elements: None
            Exploit:  You may flip the Mainsail of any Piratical
                      Proposal to Tyrannical, and then flip the Mainsail
                      of a different Tyrannical proposal to Piratical.


Amend Rule 2076 [Card cards] by appending the following text:
        Caption:  Not Your Turn
        Elements: Budgeted, Delayed[2]
        Exploit:  You may specify a card play that has occurred
                  in the past 48 hours, and (1) that card shall
                  be deemed to have not been played, and (2) the
                  gambler who originally played that card may not
                  play a copy of that card for the next 72 hours.

The Budgeted quota for Not Your Turn is hereby set to 3.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

Not Your Turn can be interpreted two ways:
  1.  Not Your Turn cancels the exploit of a card; the card has still
been played, and is in the possession of the Discard Pile.
  2.  Not Your Turn retroactively cancels the entire action of playing a
card; the card is still in the possession of the playing Gamblor.

The exploit of Not Your Turn states that the targeted card "shall be
deemed to have not been played" (Caller's Evidence 2).  I understand
this as supporting interpretation #2.

Rule changes may not have retroactive application, and ratification of
reports does not make retroactive changes.  Otherwise, retroactivity is
not discussed in the Ruleset.  Accordingly, no other Rule trumps my
understanding of Not Your Turn.

Accordingly, Goethe's play of Not Your Turn canceled eir play of Discard
Picking, and Discard Picking remains in eir hand.

This means that e DID NOT have a Not Your Turn card.  Therefore eir play
of Not Your Turn fails, and eir play of Discard Picking was not
canceled.

This means that e DID obtain a Not Your Turn card.  Therefore eir play
of Not Your Turn was valid.

Lather, rinse, repeat.

Accordingly, this CFJ is in PARADOX, and cannot be conclusively
determined to be true or false.  Under R1565(ii), I DISMISS this CFJ.
