Attention Rulekeepor! This CFJ contains an Injunction to annotate
a Rule!

======================================================================

                               CFJ 939

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",
is a less natural (though still valid) construct.  Given such an
ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.
