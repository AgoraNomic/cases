This excerpt from rule 2478:
{{{
      A player CAN, by announcement, "note" an unforgiven infraction
      committed by any other player in the last 7 days, specifying the
      incident and the rule it violates (or name of the Infraction if
      it has one).
}}}


Caller's Arguments:

G. got the name of the infraction wrong (its actual name is Weekly
Tardiness). Rule 2478 seems to be ambiguous: it can be read as either
*requiring* the name of the infraction to be specified if it has one,
or as *offering the alternative* of naming the infraction if it has a
name. With the former reading, G.'s action failed because it did not
name the infraction correctly. With the latter reading, it may have
succeeded (the rule number is correct), although there's still some
potential doubt as to whether incorrectly naming the infraction might
invalidate the action even though it would have succeeded with no name
at all.

(Note that this has no real impact on the current gamestate because an
infraction can be investigated regardless of whether or not it has been
noted; however, it affects the Referee's obligations and the contents
of the Referee's Report, and thus has gamestate relevance in a more
general way.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge snail's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 4049 TRUE.

The use of "or" here seems to plainly indicate the latter reading, as the
former reading would require stronger language like "unless" or "instead".
This interpretation also would make noting infractions less error-prone,
preventing unnecessary corrections published to the list. It is also
unambiguous enough what the action to be taken was, given the presence of
the incident specification and the rule number.
