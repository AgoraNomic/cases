Caller's Evidence:

Equation of CFJ 1915:
0. The text of this equation CAN be modified using any mechanism that
would be effective in modifying the Vote Market agreement (treating
"parties" for the purposes of the mechanism as parties to the Vote
Market agreement). Changes made using such mechanisms are INVALID
unless published. Parties to the Vote Market CAN become a party to
this equation by announcement. Non-parties to the Vote Market CAN
cease to be a party to this equation by announcement.
1. After comex's VP is at least 50 while this equation is in effect,
any party to the Vote Market CAN terminate this equation by
announcement.
2. Each week, comex SHALL submit Sell Tickets which, if filled, would
increase eir VP to at least 50 or by at least 15.
3. The other parties to the Vote Market agreement SHOULD suggest Sell
Tickets that they would fill or submit Buy Tickets that comex can
fill. Such suggestions and tickets SHOULD be for actions which would
not be obviously against comex's best interests.

========================================================================

Judge Wooble's Arguments:

In CFJ 1927, my judgment is the following Equation:

1. Each first-class party to this equation (the first-class members of
the CFJ 1915 equation at the time CFJ 1927 was called), with the
exception of comex, CAN, during the 30 days following this equation
becoming binding, specify one Agoran Decision with two or more days
remaining before its resolution and one valid vote on that decision by
announcement.
2. Comex SHALL cast one valid vote on each Agoran Decision specified
in #1 matching the vote requested by the party specifying that
Decision.  This vote must remain validly cast until the Agoran
Decision has been resolved.  If more votes on a particular Decision
are specified than comex can cast on that Decision, then e MAY choose
which of the specified votes e SHALL cast and e is released from eir
obligation to satisfy the excess requests for that Decision.
3. After this equation has been binding for 30 days or after all
eligible parties have specified Agoran Decisions on which comex shall
vote, IF AND ONLY IF Comex has fulfilled all eir obligations in #2,
the parties to this equation SHALL take such actions necessary to
modify the Vote Market agreement such that comex can leave the
agreement without incurring further obligations.
