      The destruction of the Bazinga asset would lead to the destruction
      of one or more rules, but for the Rule 'Agora is a Nomic'

Caller's Arguments:

CuddleBeam might have succeeded in making the Bazinga a private asset.
However, I find no authority in the rules that would allow em to make a
private asset that was also another entity (and if e failed to make it an
asset at all, that would be why; it depends on whether that failing is
separate from the asset creation failing). I find even less authority for
making it so that the destruction of an asset could repeal a rule, although
even if it could this attempt would likely fail because rule changes need
to happen in a defined order. Finally, Agora is a Nomic clearly intervenes
to stop the ruleset from being destroyed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

Per my judgement of CFJ 3843, Bazinga isn't an asset, thus the statement
is overly hypothetical.

DISMISS.

For completeness, even if Bazinga was an asset, the statement would
depend on how it was being destroyed. In particular, Rule 2577's 'An
asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner' would also be overridden
by Rule 105 (both are Power 3) which only allows rules to be destroyed
(repealed) by a statute (entity with positive Power), which does not
include either HAMT or Cuddle Beam; Rule 2577 would have to attempt to
act directly (e.g. 'An asset is destroyed when its owner announces it')
in order to overcome that layer of protection.


Short version: this clearly doesn't work, but the judge gets to explain
exactly why it doesn't work. Have fun, your honor.
