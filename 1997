    Any person can join this contract by announcement. 2. Any person
    other than Quazie can leave this contract by announcement. 3. Any
    person other than Quazie can perform any action on behalf of Quazie
    by announcement. }} 2 - Without 3 objections , I hereby amend the
    OBJECTIONABLE contract to read: {{ 1. Any person can join this

History:

Called by Quazie:                       09 Jun 2008 20:41:32 GMT
Assigned to Wooble:                     13 Jun 2008 05:21:26 GMT
Judged TRUE by Wooble:                  17 Jun 2008 01:20:28 GMT

========================================================================

Gratuitous Evidence by Quazie:

The original OBJECTIONABLE contract  before any potential action by comex:
{
1. The name of this contract is Objectionable.  Objectionable is a
Pledge.

2. Pheonix Wright is responsible for maintaining this contract. if
this contract is a contest Pheonix Wright is its contest master.
Initially Quazie is Pheonix Wright.

2. Vote Points (VP) are a currency used in the Vote Market. A party
CAN NOT take an action that would cause the VP of any party to be
reduced below zero. The Broker is the recordkeeper of VP.

3. Any player may become party to this agreement by announcement.
Parties to this agreement are known as Lawyers.  As soon as possible
after a player becomes party to this agreement for the first time
Pheonix Wright shall create 10 OBJECTIONS in eir possession.  Any
Lawyer may cease to be party to this agreement by announcement.
Any OBJECTIONS in eir possession are destroyed.

4. OBJECTIONS are a currency. Pheonix Wright is the recordkeeper
of OBJECTIONS.

5. This contract CAN be amended by any Lawyer without three objections.
}

The following is an argument for CFJs 1999 and 2000

Both CFJ 1999 and 2000 are likely FALSE if comex's attempt to change
the Objectionable contract as e attempted to do when e posted:

"
I join OBJECTIONABLE.
I transfer 3 OBJECTIONS to Quazie.
Without 3 OBJECTIONS (I don't have any, for that matter), I hereby
amend the OBJECTIONABLE contract to read:
{{
1. Any person can join this contract by announcement.
2. Any person other than Quazie can leave this contract by announcement.
3. Any person other than Quazie can perform any action on behalf of
Quazie by announcement.
}}

"
was unsuccessful.

========================================================================

Judge Wooble's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 1997 TRUE.  The OBJECTIONABLE contract defined a currency
called OBJECTIONS.  It's consistent in its capitalization, so in the
context of discussing the cotract or attempting to change it,
OBJECTIONS is not an R754 synonym for R1728 objections, as the
difference in spelling through a change in capitalization creates an
ambiguity in meaning in that context.
