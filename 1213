    Rule 1927 prevents the Executor of (the Mintor of) a Bank Currency
    from Minting a number of units of that Currency, unless e makes an
    announcement as described in clause a) and specifying that e intends
    to Mint that number of units of that Currency.

Assigned to Palnatoke:                  06 May 2000 22:42:17 GMT

========================================================================

Judge Palnatoke's Arguments:

Rule 1927/0 restricts the minting of a Bank Currency, so that in order to Mint
new units of that Currency, the Executor (of the Mintor of) the Bank Currency
must announce eir intent between seven and fourteen days prior to the time of
minting.

Now, what is it "to announce one's intent"?

The words 'intent' or 'intend' can be found in a number of rules:

Rule 478/10 (Power=1) The Public Forum:
      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

Rule 1003/2 (Power=2) No Coercive Proposals:
      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience shall not take effect even if
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 1370/9 (Power=1) How to Get a Degree:
      No Degree may be Granted to any recipient unless the recipient
      has posted a Thesis to the Public Forum authored by eirself,
      along with a statement explicitly indicating that the Thesis is
      being submitted with the intent to qualify for a Degree.  The
      Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

Rule 1483/7 (Power=1) Definition of Proposals:
      A Proposal is created when a Legislator who is not Mute sends a
      body of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication that
      it is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection of text
      becomes a Proposal and the entity delivering that text becomes
      the Proposer of that Proposal. This process is known as
      Proposing or submitting a Proposal.

      The delivery of text identical to another Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previous does not create a
      new Proposal unless accompanied by a clear and explicit
      indication that the intent was to Propose a duplicate Proposal.

Rule 1728/7 (Power=1) Dependent Actions:
      A Player may, in a Public Forum, unambiguously describe a
      particular Dependent Action which e is authorised by the
      Rules to perform Dependently, and announce eir intent to
      perform it.  That Player may perform that action if and only if:

      (a)  e announced eir intent at most fourteen days before
            attempting to perform it, and, in the case of Actions
            Without N Objections, at least four days before attempting
            to perform it;

Rule 1917/2 (Power=1) General Currency Taxation:
      a) All elements required to be specified in the announcement
         of the levy must also be specified in the annoucement of
         intent to issue the levy.
...
      d) The annoucement of intent to issue the levy may not take
         place while another attempt to levy a tax on that Currency
         is pending under the authority of this Rule.

Rule 1927/0 (Power=1) Bank Currency Creation:
      a) E announces eir intent between seven and fourteen days
         prior to the time of minting.


Rules 478, 1370 and 1483 speak of clear/explicit indication of intent.
Rule 1003 seems to speak of intent 'in the common language sense'.
Rules 1728 speaks of Dependent Actions.
Rules 1917 and 1927 seem to refer to Rule 1728, because taxation or creation
of currency are Dependent Actions, unless the Recordkeepor or Executor,
respectively, is a Cabinet member.

a) If the Executor of a Currency is a member of the Cabinet, eir Action needs
no Support.
Needing no Support, the Action is not a Dependent Action.
b) If the Executor of a Currency is not a member of the Cabinet, eir Action
needs the Support of two Cabinet members.
Needing Support, the Action is a Dependent Action.

If the Action is Dependent, Rule 1728's procedure must be followed - meaning
that the intended Action must be described unambiguously, which I take to mean
'the precise number of units must be mentioned'. In this case, the Statement
must be judged TRUE.

If the Action is not Dependent, there is no reason to interpret 'intent' in
the strict sense of Rule 1728. In this case, the Statement must be judged
FALSE.

As the Statement speaks of Executor of (the Mintor of) a Bank Currency, but
makes no reference to the Executor being or not being a member of the Cabinet.
Hence, I DISMISS this CFJ.

Judge Palnatoke's Evidence:

Rule 478/10 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      Whether a given medium is a Public Forum or not is a Nomic
      Property.  The Registrar is authorized to change whether a given
      medium is a Public Forum or not Without Objection.  When such
      a change is made, in order to be effective, the message
      announcing the change must be sent to both a medium that was a
      Public Forum before the change, and a medium that is a Public
      Forum after the change.  (If a single medium is a Public Forum
      both before and after the change, a single message to that
      medium satisfies this requirement.)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

      Whenever the Rules call upon some Player to "announce", "post",
      or "distribute" some communication or notification, this shall
      be accomplished by posting the communication or notification to
      the Public Forum, unless another rule specifies otherwise.

Rule 1003/2 (Power=2)
No Coercive Proposals

      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience shall not take effect even if
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 1370/9 (Power=1)
How to Get a Degree

      A Degree is Granted by the operation of an instrument of
      sufficient Power specifying the Degree to be Granted, and its
      recipient.  The sufficient Power required to Grant a Degree is
      determined by the Degree to be Granted.  All conditions
      established by this and other Rules for the Granting of the
      named Degree must have been fulfilled before the Degree may be
      Granted.

      No Degree may be Granted to any recipient unless the recipient
      has posted a Thesis to the Public Forum authored by eirself,
      along with a statement explicitly indicating that the Thesis is
      being submitted with the intent to qualify for a Degree.  The
      Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

      The Degree of Bachelor of Nomic shall not be Granted unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 1.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic History shall not be Granted
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words and contains a narrative covering significant events
      which have occured in Agora within at least the last eight
      weeks, and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power
      of at least 2.

      The Degree of Master of Nomic shall not be Granted unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 2.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic Philosophy shall not be Granted
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words, unless the intended recipient has also posted in the
      Public Forum an additional creative work authored by emself
      whose topic or theme is related to Agora or Nomic in general,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 3.

Rule 1483/7 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created when a Legislator who is not Mute sends a
      body of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication that
      it is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection of text
      becomes a Proposal and the entity delivering that text becomes
      the Proposer of that Proposal. This process is known as
      Proposing or submitting a Proposal.

      The delivery of text identical to another Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previous does not create a
      new Proposal unless accompanied by a clear and explicit
      indication that the intent was to Propose a duplicate Proposal.

      The publishing of the Proposal Queue never creates new
      Proposals.

      All Players are Legislators.  A Player is Mute while e has more
      than 5 Blots.

Rule 1728/7 (Power=1)
Dependent Actions

      An action is Dependent (or may be performed Dependently) if
      and only if it is an Action With N Objections or an Action
      With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer not greater
      than five.  The phrase `Without Objection' is synonymous with
      `Without 1 Objection', and the phrase `With Support' is
      synonymous with `With 1 Supporter'.  The Rules may authorise
      classes of Dependent Actions.

      A Player may, in a Public Forum, unambiguously describe a
      particular Dependent Action which e is authorised by the
      Rules to perform Dependently, and announce eir intent to
      perform it.  That Player may perform that action if and only if:

      (a)  e announced eir intent at most fourteen days before
            attempting to perform it, and, in the case of Actions
            Without N Objections, at least four days before attempting
            to perform it;

      (b)  the authorising Rule explicitly indicates who may perform
           the action Dependently;

      (c)  during the time between the announcement made under
           (a) of this Rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  fewer than N Players have posted, in a Public
                Forum, Objections to the performance of the
                action, if the action is to be performed
                Without N Objections; or

           (2)  at least N Players have posted, in a Public
                Forum, Support for the performance of the
                action, if the action is to be performed With
                N Supporters; and

      (d)  e announces, in a Public Forum, that e performs the
           described action.

      Properties which would be changed by a Dependent Action
      do not occur until announced as in (d).

      The specification in the Rules that an action may be
      performed Dependently in no way prohibits performing that
      same action if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

      Other Rules may specify further restrictions upon the
      performance of Dependent Actions.

Rule 1917/2 (Power=1)
General Currency Taxation

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may levy a tax on that Currency,
      subject to the following restrictions:

      a) All elements required to be specified in the announcement
         of the levy must also be specified in the annoucement of
         intent to issue the levy.
      b) The Effective Time of the levy must be between seven and
         fourteen days after the time of the annoucement of the
         intent to issue the levy.
      c) The Effective Time of a levy is at least one month after the
         last Effective Time of a levy on that Currency issued under
         the authority of this Rule.
      d) The annoucement of intent to issue the levy may not take
         place while another attempt to levy a tax on that Currency
         is pending under the authority of this Rule.
      e) If the Currency is a Bank Currency, then either the
         Recordkeepor is a member of the Cabinet at the time e
         levies the tax, or eir action has the support of two current
         Cabinet members.

      The tax may include exemptions on a fixed amount of the holdings
      of every taxable entity, provided that:

         (i) All Players are exempt identical amounts,
        (ii) All Non-players are exempt identical amounts,
       (iii) The Non-players' exemption is less than or equal to the
             Players' exemption.

Rule 1927/0 (Power=1)
Bank Currency Creation

      The Executor of a Bank Currency may Mint new units of that
      Currency, subject to the following restrictions:

      a) E announces eir intent between seven and fourteen days
         prior to the time of minting.
      b) Either e is a member of the Cabinet at the time e mints
         the currency, or eir action has the support of two Cabinet
         members.
