Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

As previous judge I request REASSIGN -- I think I've been
responsible for a lot of the official (rather than gratuitous) precedents
on personhood and it would be good to have another voice in here.  Also,
just had a new addition to the family (two weeks earlier than expected
but healthy and happy :) ) so I might be a bit distracted from the
intricacies of such a case for a few weeks!  -G.

Panelist ais523's Arguments:

I opine REASSIGN on both; if a judge is busy for personal reasons
(congratulations, by the way!), a better result is likely by assigning
to a different judge.
