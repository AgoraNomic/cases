Caller:                                 Machiavelli

History:

Called by Machiavelli:                  18 Sep 2008 22:48:02 GMT
Assigned to root:                       23 Sep 2008 08:30:50 GMT
Judged TRUE by root:                    25 Sep 2008 17:54:14 GMT

Caller's Arguments:

Normish contains, is, or runs on a Linux server which contains a script
allowing its users to alter the server's contents arbitrarily.
Treating this as a nomic ruleset, this makes Normish a nomic.

========================================================================

Judge root's Arguments:

If Normish is a nomic, then its operating system is its ruleset.  The
standard set of tools in a Linux system, combined with root access,
are sufficient to make arbitrary changes to the system, including
replacing the operating system in its entirety.  I judge TRUE.
