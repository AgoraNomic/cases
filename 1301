==============================  CFJ 1301  ==============================

    Rule 1479 should be interpreted such that an Order, which requires a
    Player to pay out one or more Properties to some entity, and which
    is valid and proper under the Rules, causes the Bank to incur one or
    more debts to the named entity.

Judge Syllepsis's Arguments:

Rule 1479 clearly states that if a Rule requires a player to "pay
out" Properties, the Bank incurs a debt to the entity to which the
Properties are to be given.

Let there be a valid Order requiring a Player to "pay out" one or more
Properties to some entity. Then if there exists a Rule requiring the
Player to obey Orders, then by such a Rule the Player would be required to
"pay out" Properties to some entity, thus invoking Rule 1479.

Rule 1810 specifies that if a valid Order requires an action to be
performed within a specified time, and this action is not performed, then
the Player commits the Class 4 Crime of Contempt by Inaction. Thus by Rule
1810, such a valid Order invokes Rule 1479 if it is required to be
performed within a specific time frame.

Rule 1795 insures that a Rule without a time specification or an invalid
time specification automatically has the specification ASAP, thus invoking
Rule 1810 and thus Rule 1479.

Thus any valid Order has a time specification and thus invokes Rule 1810,
stating that the Order must be carried out. If the Order is to pay out one
or more Properties to some entity, then by Rule 1810 the Player is
required to pay out one or more Properties to some entity. This triggers
Rule 1479, so the Bank then incurs a debt.

Therefore, I judge this CFJ to be TRUE.

Judge Syllepsis's Evidence:

Rule 1810/3 (Power=1)
Noncompliance with Orders

      An Order requiring an entity to perform an action is satisfied
      when that entity performs that action.  Other Rules may define
      other ways for Orders to be satisfied.

      If an Order requires an entity to perform an action prior to a
      specified time, and the Order is not satisfied prior to that
      time specified in the Order commits the Class 4 Crime of
      Contempt by Inaction.

      Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
      the satisfaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
      satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
      the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.


Rule 1479/3 (Power=1)
Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill"

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player to pay out one or more
      Properties to some entity, the Bank shall incur a debt to that
      entity for those Properties, and the named Player shall, as
      soon as possible, post a public notice of the debt.

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player to bill an entity for one or
      more Properties, that entity shall incur a debt to the Bank for
      those Properties, and the named Player shall, as soon as
      possible, post a public notice of the debt.


Rule 1795/3 (Power=1)
Timing Requirements of Orders

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, or if the specification given would allow less than
      72 hours from the time when the Order takes effect to perform
      the action, then the Order shall be taken to require the
      performance of the action as soon as possible after the Order
      takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, and the
      specification would require the performance of the action at a
      time before the current holder of the position came to hold
      that position, or would allow less than 72 hours from the time
      the current holder of the position came to hold that position,
      then the Order shall be taken to require the performance of the
      action as soon as possible after the current holder of the
      position came to hold that position.  However, this shall
      not be taken to absolve the previous holder of the position
      of any penalties e might otherwise incur.

      Other Rules may establish other times by which Orders must be
      performed.  The noncompliance of an Order with this Rule does
      not deprive that Order of all effect, but instead modifies the
      effect of that Order with respect to the time at which or by
      which the actions it requires must be performed.
