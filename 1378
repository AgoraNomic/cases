========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1638 establishes a way for Players to win the game by publishing
a Notice of Victory.  It refers to Players being "eligible to Win" when
they meet Win Conditions, and it says that iff the Notice of Victory is
accurate, then the Players who are "eligible to Win" immediately "Win".
As of this CFJ, no such Notice of Victory has been published as a
result of Proposal 4296.

However, Rule 112 takes precedence over Rule 1638, and it simply uses
the language that a Player "Wins" whenever e meets some Win condition,
the same language that is used by Rule 1638 upon the completion of a
Notice of Victory.  This seems to mean that Rule 112 establishes a
second way to win, which is simply to meet a Win condition.  As a
side effect, this interpretation would completely preempt Rule 1638,
but that doesn't mean that it isn't valid.

Rule 1729, which permits the win in question, adds to the confusion by
using the same language as Rule 112, merely saying that "the Proposer
shall Win".  It does not say that the Proposer shall be "eligible to
Win", or that the Proposer shall meet any Win condition.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1638/5 (Power=1)
Announcing a Win

       When one or more Win Conditions are true for a Player and no
       Win-Preventing Conditions are, e is eligible to Win. Any Player
       may then publish a Notice of Victory containing the following
       information:

         a) The fact that one or more Players are eligible to Win
         b) The cause of the Win
         c) The identity of every Player who is eligible to Win at
            the time the message is sent

       If and only if the information contained in the Notice of
       Victory is accurate, the Player or Players who are identified
       as being eligible to Win immediately Win the Game.

Excerpt from Rule 112/3 (Power=3)

                               A Player Wins whenever a Win condition
       defined by one or more of those Rules occurs for that Player,
       provided that no Win-Preventing conditions are also occurring at
       that time for that Player.

Excerpt from Rule 1729/4 (Power=1)

       And should such a Proposal's Voting Period begin,
       but no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

Excerpts from Assessor's Voting Report
Message-ID:
<Pine.A41.4.44.0205101012090.82960-100000@homer35.u.washington.edu>

4296   A MODEST PROPOSAL               root       1  I     FAILED  QUORUM
...
Please note:
No one voted FOR Insane Proposal 4296.

========================================================================

Judge Steve's Arguments:

Facts in evidence:

Proposal 4296 was an Insane Proposal, proposed by root. Assessor Goethe
announced the results of this Proposal on Fri, 10 May 2002 17:43:00 GMT
(see Evidence <1>). The vote was 1 vote AGAINST, 0 votes FOR. No Notice
of Victory was published on or around May 10.

Arguments:

R1638 claims that the only way a Player can Win the Game is by
publication of an accurate Notice of Victory identifying the Player as
having met a Win Condition (and as having no Win-Preventing Conditions).
On the face of it, then, since no Notice of Victory was published on or
around May 10, root could not have Won the Game at that time.

Against this view, the Caller argues that R112 says that a Player Wins
whenever e meets some Win Condition. It's hard to avoid the conclusion
that the Caller's argument is correct: R112 conflicts with, and takes
precedence over, R1638's claim that the only way to win is via
publication of a Notice of Victory.

The only thing remaining is to establish whether there was some Win
Condition that root met on or around May 10, 2002. Concerning Insane
Proposals, R1729 states:

      And should such a Proposal's Voting Period begin,
      but no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

Although the term 'Win Condition' does not appear in R1729, there is
judicial precedent that some poetic license is permitted in interpreting
Rules written in verse (see CFJ 1309, in which "bended" is interpreted
to mean "broken"; but for a contrary and more literal view of this
passage, see CFJ 1284). It is reasonable, I think, to interpret R1729 as
defining a Win Condition.

I therefore Judge that the Statement is TRUE.

Judge Steve's Evidence:

<1> Assessor Goethe's announcement of the results of Proposal 4296

========================================================================
Rules referred to in this Judgement:

Rule 1638/5 (Power=1)
Announcing a Win

      When one or more Win Conditions are true for a Player and no
      Win-Preventing Conditions are, e is eligible to Win. Any Player
      may then publish a Notice of Victory containing the following
      information:

        a) The fact that one or more Players are eligible to Win
        b) The cause of the Win
        c) The identity of every Player who is eligible to Win at
           the time the message is sent

      If and only if the information contained in the Notice of
      Victory is accurate, the Player or Players who are identified
      as being eligible to Win immediately Win the Game.


Rule 112/3 (Power=3)
Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof

      Ways for a Player to Win a Game may be defined by other Rules.
      Also, ways to prevent a Player from Winning a Game may be
      defined by other Rules. A Player Wins whenever a Win condition
      defined by one or more of those Rules occurs for that Player,
      provided that no Win-Preventing conditions are also occurring at
      that time for that Player.


Rule 1729/4 (Power=1)
Insanity

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      And should a Player split eir votes 'tween FOR and
          AGAINST like crazy,
      E will annoy Assessors (who are known for being lazy)
      So should eir votes cast differ from each other, this Rule's
          broke,
      With the breaker being the voting Player, as sure as if e'd
          spoke.

      And should such a Proposal's Voting Period begin,
      but no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.


Rule 451/3 (Power=1)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

      When a Judge is considering eir Judgement of a Statement
      contained in a CFJ, e shall make eir evaluation based on the
      truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was
      issued.
