Arguments of Caller (Zefram):

When Jeff's Piggy Bank was created on 25th July 1995, a Treasury was
created for it in accordance with Rule 1469/0.  When Jeff's Piggy Bank
was dissolved on 26th July, its (empty) Treasury was emptied *but not
destroyed* by Rule 1469/0,  As there is no Rule that allows the
destruction of Treasuries, it still exists.

This applies to all Treasuries whose owners ceased to exist after
Currency Reform.  There are several such empty Treasuries, which it is
still possible to transfer Currencies into.

============================================================

Argument of the Judge (Swann)

The general thrust of this CFJ is the determination of A) if the Rules
provide, implicitly or explicitly, for the destruction of a Treasury,
and B) if such a provision exists, does such apply to the specific case
of Jeff's Piggy Bank?

The Caller is correct in that 1469/0 does not provide for the
destruction of any Treasury.  If the matter was only that of 1469/0
alone, the Caller's Statement would be valid.  It is valid, in fact,
to say that there is no Rule that explicitly provides for the
destruction of a Treasury.

Is there a Rule that implicitly does so?

According to Rule 1468/0:

     "The possession of Treasuries may never be changed, once created."

This is the crux of the matter.  If the Entity possessing a Treasury
ceases to exist, it cannot change ownership of the Treasury, even to
the extent of creating an "ownerless" Treasury.  The Entty only has
the option of retaining the Treasury into its nonexistence.  This 
clause of 1468/0 makes a Treasury and its owner an indivisible
single Entity.  1468/0 enforces such an interpretation by saying:

     "Whenever an Entity ossesses only one Treasury, it shall be a
      permissible and unambiguous abbreviation to state that the
      Entity possesses the Currencies within its Treasury."

In other words, Jeff's Piggy Bank owned the currencies within its
Treasury, and in effect, the Treasury was a *part* of Jeff's Piggy Bank
and ceased to exist along with it.


Additional Evidence:
----------------------------------------

Rule 1468/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of a Treasury

      A Treasury is a repository for holding Currencies.  Currencies
      may exist only within a Treasury.  A Treasury may contain a
      positive, negative, or zero quantity of a given Currency, unless
      otherwise prohibited by the Rules.  Currencies may be
      transferred between Treasuries only as specified in the Rules.

      Only those Nomic Entities which are authorized by the Rules to
      possess Treasuries may possess Treasuries.  No Treasury may be
      possessed by more than one Nomic Entity.  The possession of
      Treasuries may never be changed, once created.

      Each Player and each Group has a Treasury of its own.

      Whenever an Entity possesses only one Treasury, it shall be a
      permissible and unambiguous abbreviation to state that the
      Entity possesses the Currencies within its Treasury.

Evidence provided by Caller (Zefram):

1. Rule 1469/0: Creation and Destruction of Treasuries

----------------------------------------

Rule 1469/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creation and Destruction of Treasuries

      Whenever an Entity which is permitted to possess a Treasury is
      created, or an existing Entity is granted the permission to
      possess a Treasury, a Treasury is created for that Entity.  Such
      a new Treasury shall initially contain no Currencies, unless
      otherwise specified in the Rules.

      Whenever an Entity which possesses a Treasury ceases to exist or
      ceases to be permitted to possess a Treasury, all Currencies
      within are immediately transferred to the Treasuries of the
      Mintors of the respective Currencies.
