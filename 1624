Caller's Arguments:

Rule 2009's last paragraph read

      (b) The Rulekeepor may repeal this Rule Without Objection if
          there are no Elder Oligarchs.

Rulekeepor Michael claimed to repeal rule 2009 under this provision on
or about 19 February 2002.  I don't have the message to quote, but the
RCS log for revision 1.38 of Michael's FLR file says "Rule 2009 repealed
because no more Elder Oligarchs exist.".

Rule 2037's last paragraph read

      If each Player has at least one listed address, then the
      Registrar may repeal this Rule by announcing that e does so.

Registrar Murphy claimed to repeal rule 2037 under this provision on
6 April 2003, in a message with subject "BUS: Re: address change"
(available at <http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/
agora-business/2003-April/001328.html>) which read in part

|Proposal 4435 grandfathered all preferred addresses into being listed,
|and to the best of my knowledge, there are no Players lacking a listed
|address.  Therefore, as Registrar, I repeal Rule 2037 (Orange Alert)
|by announcement, as permitted by that same Rule.

These processes are both very similar to the later case of rule 2050.
Rule 2050's last paragraph read

      If there are no Players that hold at least one Weed or Daffodil,
      the Herald may repeal this Rule without Objection.

Herald root claimed to repeal rule 2050 under this provision on
20 April 2004, in a message with subject "BUS: license to repeal"
(available at <http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/
agora-business/2004-April/002728.html>) which read in part

|There having been no objection, I hereby repeal R2050.

Rule 2050's status was the subject of CFJ 1499, on the statement
"Rule 2050 has been repealed.".  The case file is available at
<http://zenith.homelinux.net/cotc/viewcase.php?cfj=1499>.  Judge Kolja's
judgement, upheld on appeal, was FALSE, on the grounds that rule 1322 only
allowed rule changes to be specified by instruments of sufficient Power.
E judged that in this case it was the Herald that was specifying the
rule change, not rule 2050, and that the Herald is not an instrument
(had Power 0).  Rule 2050 was restored to the published rulesets, and
later repealed in the ordinary manner by proposal 4683 on 18 April 2005.

The same version of R1322, 1322/3, was in effect at the time of all three
of these purported repeals by officers.  I reckon that the reasoning
of CFJ 1499 applies identically to all three rules.  Therefore, like
R2050, R2009 and R2037 could not be repealed by officers under their
own provisions.

Rules 2009 and 2037 have not been the subject of any CFJ, have not
been restored to the published rulesets, and have not been repealed or
otherwise affected by any subsequent adopted proposal.

I therefore conclude that rules 2009 and 2037 have not been repealed,
and are still rules.  I urge the judge to judge TRUE on that basis.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1322/3 (Power=3)
Effectiveness of Rule Changes

      A given Rule Change shall not take effect unless the Power of
      the instrument which specified it is at least as great as the
      greater of the current Power of the Rule to be Changed (if any)
      and the Power the Rule would have after the Change (if any).

Rule 2009/0 (Power=2)
Elder Oligarchs

      (a) Upon the creation of this Rule, all Players who were Low,
          Middle, or High Oligarchs when the Proposal creating this
          Rule was adopted become Oligarchs. Each of these Players is
          an Elder Oligarch until e ceases to be an Oligarch or until
          e has been an Elder Oligarch for 3 months.

      (b) The Rulekeepor may repeal this Rule Without Objection if
          there are no Elder Oligarchs.

History:
Created by Proposal 4221 (Steve), 10 October 2001
<this version>
Purportedly Repealed by Rulekeepor via Rule 2009, ca. 19 February 2002
  [effectiveness subject to this CFJ]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2037/0 (Power=1)
Orange Alert

      If a Player has no listed e-mail address, then the address used
      to send eir next public message becomes listed.

      If each Player has at least one listed address, then the
      Registrar may repeal this Rule by announcing that e does so.

History:
Created by Proposal 4435 (Murphy), 28 January 2003
<this version>
Purportedly Repealed by Registrar via Rule 2037, 6 April 2003
  [effectiveness subject to this CFJ]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2050/0 (Power=2)
The Garden

      A Daffodil is a Boon that may be awarded as the Rules specify or
      by an Instrument of Power 2 or greater.

      A Weed is an Albatross that may be awarded as the Rules specify
      or by an Instrument of Power 2 or greater.

      If there are no Players that hold at least one Weed or Daffodil,
      the Herald may repeal this Rule without Objection.

History:
Created by Proposal 4486 (Michael), 24 April 2003
<this version>
Purportedly Repealed by Herald via Rule 2050, 20 April 2004

Judge Levi's Arguments:

I find that the arguments presented in CFJ 1499 also hold in the case.
