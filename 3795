Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

Remember that we're talking about a forward.  We give TTTPF messages the 
date stamp of the forward, not the original.

Judge G.'s Arguments:

I judge CFJ 3795 FALSE.  If you
forward a message to yourself, then later forward it to the forum, the
operative timestamp is when it left your control for the forum (i.e.
the timestamps of the forwarded message).   This is similar to sending
something to the DF, then forwarding it with a TTTTPF - the time used
is the time of the forwarding.
