Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1728/10 (Dependent Actions; Power=2) states that an action is
a dependent action only if it is an action with N support or an action
without N objections, where N is a positive integer, and also permits
rules to restrict eligibility of supporters or objectors.  Because
0 is not a positive integer, rubberstamping with 0 support is not a
dependent action.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

1.  Rule  101/ 1 (Obey the Rules; Power=3)
2.  Rule 1728/10 (Dependent Actions; Power=2)
3.  Rule 1986/ 5 (Role-Based Powers; Power=2)
4.  Cecilius's first attempt in the current Agoran week to rubberstamp
    a proposal (some headers elided)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.

Rule 101/1 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in
      effect, in the form in which they are currently in effect.
      However, a Player besides the Speaker may always deregister
      rather than continue to play.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
      permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permit it.  Any change to the game state which would
      make it impossible to make arbitrary modifications to the Rules
      by any combination of actions by Players does not occur, any
      Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of
      the first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
      (Immutable) and 201-219 (Mutable).

Rule 1728/10 (Power=2)
Dependent Actions

      An action is dependent, or may be performed dependently, if and
      only if it is an Action Without N Objections or an Action With N
      Supporters, where N is a positive integer.  The phrase "Without
      Objection" is synonymous with "Without 1 Objection", and the
      phrase "With Support" is synonymous with "With 1 Supporter".

      A player may publicly announce eir intent to perform an
      unambiguously described dependent action.  A player may perform
      a previously unambiguously described dependent action if and
      only if:

      (a)  no more than fourteen days have passed since the
           announcement of intent to perform the action;

      (b)  if the action to be performed is an Action Without N
           Objections, at least four days have passed since the
           announcement made under (a) of this rule;

      (c)  either the player who attempts to perform the action is the
           player who made the announcement under (a) of this rule, or

           (1)  the player who made the announcement under (a) of this
                rule did so by a privilege or duty granted em by
                virtue of holding a rules-defined position; and

           (2)  the player who attempts to perform the action is the
                holder of that position when e attempts to perform the
                action;

      (d)  the rules explicitly authorise the player to perform the
           action dependently;

      (e)  during the time between the announcement made under (a) of
           this rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  if the action is to be performed Without N Objections,
                fewer than N players have publicly posted objections
                to the performance of the action; or

           (2)  if the action is to be performed With N Supporters, at
                least N players other than the player who made the
                announcement under (a) of this rule have publicly
                posted support for the performance of the action;

      (f)  the announcement made under (a) of this rule specifies
           whether the action is to be performed Without N Objections
           or With N Supporters, unless the rules either do not permit
           the action to be performed Without N Objections or do not
           permit the action to be performed With N Supporters; and

      (g)  e announces that e performs the described action.

      A dependent action is not performed until announced as in (g).

      A player who posts an objection to the performance of an action
      may publicly retract eir objection.  If e does so, e shall be
      deemed not have posted an objection to the performance of that
      action for the purposes of (e)(1) of this rule.

      The specification in the rules that an action may be performed
      dependently does not prohibit performing that action
      independently if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

      A rule authorising the performance of a dependent action may
      restrict the eligibility of players to support or object to that
      specific action.

Rule 1986/5 (Power=2)
Role-Based Powers

      A Scribe may Rubberstamp a Proposal by paying a Fee in Papyri,
      or receiving the Support of a number of other Scribes, equal to
      the number of Proposals that the Scribe has previously
      Rubberstamped in the current Agoran Week (minimum zero).  A
      Rubberstamped Proposal becomes Distributable: this does not
      change its Distribution Fee.

      An Acolyte may absolve (remove) 1 Blot from any Entity by paying
      Fee in Indulgences, or receiving the Support of a number of
      other Acolytes, equal to the number of such Absolutions the
      Acolyte has previously performed in the current Agoran Week
      (minimum zero).

      An Acolyte may Exorcise a Dissolute Entity with the Support of
      another Acolyte.  The effect of Exorcism is to instantly
      transfer all of the Entity's Indulgences to the Bank.

      An Acolyte with the Support of a Scribe, or a Scribe with the
      Support of an Acolyte, may Bless an Undistributed Proposal.  A
      moment after its Distribution, a Blessed Proposal becomes
      Democratic if it is not already.

      A Politician, with the Support of another Politician, may
      Unbless an Undistributed Blessed Proposal.  An Unblessed
      Proposal is no longer Blessed.

Subject: BUS: Let Me Auction Please
Date: Sat, 1 Mar 2003 20:09:35 -0500 (EST)

As I am preparing the calculations for the Indulgence Auction this month,
it reminds me that I meant to propose a fix for a bug I see in R1712 which
did not permit me to Auction any Indulgences in February, as the
Indulgence Surplus was approximately 0.8.

R1712(d) required me to round down the Indulgence Surplus to the nearest
Integer to calculate the maximum number of Indulgences required to be
auctioned.

R1712(f) gives the Herald discretion to auction Indulgences, but only "if
the Indulgence Surplus is zero or negative..."

Therefore I submit the following Proposal, entitled "Full Discretion
Fix", and announce my intent to Rubberstamp it, with 0 Support:

     Amend Rule 1712 (Distribution of Indulgences) by replacing the words
     "zero or negative" with the words "less than one".

Having received the required Support of 0, I Rubberstamp "Full Discretion
Fix."

Judge Peekee's Arguments:

0 is not a positive integer as required in

Rule 1728/10 (Power=2)
Dependent Actions

      An action is dependent, or may be performed dependently, if and
      only if it is an Action Without N Objections or an Action With N
      Supporters, where N is a positive integer.

<snip>

Importantly, this is an if and only if definition, there are no other
definitions of a dependant action in the rules.  As such I find the
statement TRUE.
