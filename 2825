Caller's Evidence:

Rule 2282/3
Energy

      The Power Station Manager (PSM) is an office and the
      recordkeepor of ergs.  Eir weekly report shall include a list of
      all erg transactions of the previous week.

Rule 2289/0
Capacitors

       Capacitors are a class of fixed assets tracked by the PSM;
       their ownership is restricted to players.

       When an event is described as earning a player a number of
       farads, e CAN, once per such event and in a timely fashion,
       award emself an equal number of capacitors by announcement, but
       only if e cites the specific event allowing em to do so in the
       announcement.

========================================================================

Judge scshunt's Arguments:

Trivially FALSE. Capacitors don't involve ergs directly in any fashion,
so their award cannot possibly be said to be erg transactions.
