Caller's Arguments:

The rules explicitly prohibit a contract with only party.
Therefore, even if Gaelan's ISTID would succeed, e could not have made a
contract containing only one party, and if e did, the rules would have
destroyed it. On the other hand, e clearly expressed the intent to be 
bound by the contract, and therefore arguably twg's acceptance was 
actually what brought such a contract into existence.

Judge Jason Cobb's Arguments:

The only two people who have expressed an intent to be bound by Gaelan's
contract are Gaelan emself and twg.

I accept the caller's argument that Gaelan did not EFFECTIVELY created a
contract, as there was no other party at that time.

To determine whether twg created a contract with eir message, we must
examine the definition in Rule 1742:

Are these two people a "group of two or more consenting persons"? As far
as I am aware, both of them are persons, and they are both consenting,
as it is reasonably obvious that Gaelan wanted the contract to come into
force (given another party joining), and twg tried to join the possible
contract.

Is this agreement an "agreement among themselves"? It Yes, as each party
agreed to the same contract text.

Was the agreement made with the intention that it be "binding upon [the
parties] and be governed by the rules"? Yes. Both parties freely entered
into the agreement, with Gaelan having intent to be bound by eir
authorization to allow others to act on eir behalf, and with twg wishing
to gain access to that authorization. It is also clear that the
agreement was intended to be governed by the rules, as the document
purports to allow acting-on-behalf, which is something that can be
authorized by the Contracts rule, and both messages were sent to Agora's
Public Forum.

Even if no person announced that e was creating a contract, there
nevertheless exists an agreement that meets Rule 1742's definition of a
"contract". TRUE.
