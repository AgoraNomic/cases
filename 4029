Caller's Arguments:

So, after the silence, finding that a couple other players actually don't
know what "Invisibilitating" is either, and some simple searches in the
mail archives, apparently "Invisibilitating" relies on gamestate that
supposedly still exists after 10+ years. I thought we didn't dig into the
past that far to consider how many turtles down the current gamestate was
held up by, but if we do, then:

- Why would we make a special case just for Invisibilitating specifically?
What about other ancient things that may affect how other *current* things
of the game work too?
- Are we even sure that the secret Invisibilitating instrument still exists
or works as intended?
- It takes agency away from newer players and puts more into older ones
which are more familiar with this obscure ancient arcana which has now
supposedly been made relevant, which feels terrible.

Thankfully, I'm far from a win so I have a margin to endure risking some
blots, which I'll spend to try to uncover more about this.

Gratuitous Arguments by G:

Proposal 4513[0] - clearly cited in the proposal just adopted - made
the following 'pronouncement' when it took effect, and the
pronouncement was not 'rescinded' when the rule was repealed[1].  I'm
under no illusion that the pronouncement is still "taking effect" in
any legal way, but it is a unique case because (as Yachay found)
there's no common-sense definition or term findable on an internet
search, so this text - which was just voted into the rules, so must be
interpreted as the text of the rules - is the only thing I know that
potentially "clarifies" the text of the rules in a R217 definitional
sense.  Further it is clear from the text itself that it was intended
that this definition be "hidden" and continue to provide definitional
guidance (that's unique afaik when thinking of other old gamestate):

 I grepped the full BUS and OFF mboxes, and searched the CFJ archive,
and I believe that there were never any legal proceedings accusing
anyone of Invisibilitating, either while it existed in the previous
iteration or afterwards.  The only references I found were the
enactment, the repeal, and the appearances in the ruleset or the
proposal.  This vaguely matched my memory that it was rarely if ever
used.

In this special case, I disagree that we are limited to the R217
definitional sources - in particular, because there are *no* R217
definitional sources, and the "text of the rules" says
Invisibilitating is a crime, so we need to interpret that text of the
rules.  To that end, I would say we have to use the "common sense or
game custom" to find some kind of definition, outside the R217
sources.  Of course, I fully realize that it might be neither common
sense nor game custom to use the old sense of the term.
