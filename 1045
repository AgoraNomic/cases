Relevant Rules: 1563 

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1) 
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort 
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ, 
      as described elsewhere. 

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the statement", I
refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I refer to "the
CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping this consistancy
so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either TRUE
or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that the
statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the statement is
both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable. 

vacuous (vàk´y¡-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vac´uously adverb
- vac´uousness noun

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous. definition 1
would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then there would be no
statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply. definition 2a is a
matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined by
the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or both
being true) makes this CFJ true.
