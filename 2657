==============================  CFJ 2657  ==============================

    Rule 2265 (Placeholder Arms), paragraph 2, sentence 1 should be
    interpreted as "...a [possibly hypothetical] Power-1 rule...".

Caller:                                 Murphy
Barred:                                 G.

Judge:                                  Wooble
Judgement:                              TRUE

History:

Called by Murphy:                       07 Aug 2009 20:53:31 GMT
Assigned to Wooble:                     08 Aug 2009 16:15:19 GMT
Judged TRUE by Wooble:                  13 Aug 2009 14:54:57 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

This non-literal interpretation is

  a) presumably what the author intended;

  b) explicitly supported by the use of "create" in paragraph 1,
     sentence 1; and

  c) further explicitly supported by the existence of a mechanism (the
     Cleanup Procedure) for converting from hypothetical to actual.

An alternate interpretation ("Creating a Flag Candidate causes it to
become ... a Power-1 rule ...") is shot down by R754(2)(a).

========================================================================

Judge Wooble's Arguments:

I judge CFJ2657 TRUE and CFJ 2658 FALSE.  Taking the text of the rule
as a whole into consideration and applying common sense to its
interpretation, it's clear the Flag Candidate is the text and title of
the Power-1 rule that R2265 should be changed to during the Cleanup
Procedure. R2105 never became a Flag Candidate because no one
submitted it without 3 objections to cause it to become one.
