      If a player breached a power-2 rule by missing a deadline right
      now, punishing that breach would generally be appropriate.

==========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Excerpt from R1769 (power 3):
       If a person breaks a Rule by missing a deadline that occurs
       during a Holiday, punishment is generally not appropriate.

Excerpt from R2654 (power 1):
        When the device is on:
          * click - hummmmmmm
          * The week that contains the beginning of Agora's Device,
            together with the following week, is a Holiday.

Excerpts from R2140 (power 3):
       Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no entity with power below
       the power of this rule can
[...]
       3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
       with power greater than its own (that is, one that affects the
       instrument's operation).

The rules relevant to punishing rule violations (R2557, R2478, R2531)
all have Power of at least 1.7.

The Device is on.


Caller's Arguments:

Because the Device is on right now, and was created within the previous
two weeks, R2654 attempts to create a Holiday. Does it have enough
Power to a) do that, and/or b) cause the Holiday to actually do
anything?

Every rule that this could potentially be affecting has a Power greater
than R2654 does. So I think it's plausible to read R2140 as preventing
R2654 from modifying the operation of higher-power rules. The situation
is far from clear, though, which is why I think this is worth a CFJ.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Judge Jason's Arguments:

I find that the usage of "Holiday" in Rule 1769 ("Holidays") is
consistent with the natural language definition of a period of time that
is to be celebrated. The fact that it states that two time periods are
Holidays is just stating that they are time periods that we celebrate in
Agora. This means that a lower-powered Rule (such as R2654) can allow
certain time periods to be Holidays by simply asking Agora to celebrate
them.

The next question is, does Rule 2654 do this, and does it do it in a way
such that it would be a Holiday at the time of the calling of the CFJ? I
find that the reasonable reading of "The week that contains that
contains the beginning of Agora's Device" is the week that the Device
switch was first created (so, when the Device rules were enacted).

Since that week and the following week are Holidays, and Rule 1769 says
that punishment is generally not appropriate during a Holiday, TRUE.

I see nothing to suggest that this determination should depend on the
power of the breached rule. The clause about punishment being
inappropriate during Holidays is at Power 3. The fact that a Power 1
rule can make a time period a Holiday does not itself conflict with the
Power 2 rule.


Judge Jason's Evidence:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2140/5 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no entity with power below
      the power of this rule can
      
      1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.
      
      2. adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than its
      own.
      
      3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
      with power greater than its own (that is, one that affects the
      instrument's operation).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 217/12 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
      matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
      e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.
