Caller's Arguments:

E has correctly announced the Vote count, but incorrectly announced
the result of that Vote count - namely whether Proposal 4111 was
adopted.

========================================================================

Judge Syllepsis's Arguments:

It is unclear in the rules if an incorrect announcement is to be
considered an announcement at all. Logically, it seems that an incorrect
announcement of some results would actually be an announcement of results
that never took place, and so in this case the results would not have been
announced.

In t's "Assessor's Voting Report" dated Tue, 20 Feb 2001 15:38:43 e
announces first the following:

Num. Type Proposer    AI Title                         RESULT   F  A  -  *
4111 Dem  Elysion      2 Oligarchy Reform v1.2         FAILS/Q  3  0  0
4112 Ord  t            1 Banking Developments          PASSES  11  2  0  -

Here t has announced a set of results different from the actual voting
results, and has hence not announced the actual results of the vote. So at
this point, the results have not been announced.

However, t continues:

The above text is an actual legible, reasonably understandable
announcement of the results of the voting on roposal 4111.

I then conclude that t first erroneously announced a set of results
different from the results (and hence had not announced the results yet),
but then announced the actual results immediately afterwards. It follows
that the Assessor has announced the results of Proposal 4111.
