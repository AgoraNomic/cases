=============================  CFJ 3443  =============================

      The Short Logical Ruleset published by the Rulekeepor on Wed, 15
      Oct 2014 16:48:31 is misleading and therefore is a violation of
      Rule 2143 (Official Reports and Duties).

Caller's Arguments:

Line 6 of the Short Logical Ruleset published by the Rulekeepor on
Wed, 15 Oct 2014 at 16:48:31 is as follows:

"Last change to this ruleset: ???"

What should be displayed after "Last change to this ruleset:" is
the last number of the Proposal that caused a change to the
ruleset. Instead, the Rulekeepor substitutes what should be there
with "???". "???" is not indicative of a proposal ID and therefore
does not indicate what the "Last change to this ruleset" was.
Because the Rulekeepor states that the "Last change to this
Ruleset" was "???", e misleads the Agoran people and keeps the
"Last change to this Ruleset" forever hidden from the people.

======================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

FALSE. Publishing that something *is* indeterminate is not misleading.
