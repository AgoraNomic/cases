Caller's Arguments: 

I said "The procedure for this auction shall be a
Selective-Bid Auction, as described by the Treasuror's Auction
Regulations" but then continued to link to the ACORN of 13 August. The
correct ACORN would have been the one from 30 August[1], which
includes my edits[2]. So what happened?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Judge Jason's Arguments:

The link to the ACORN in the auction initiation message contains a
different regulation state than the current auction regulations (and
this is known to be the case, as the platonic state of the regulations
is not currently in dispute). As such, I find that the auction method
was not "specified by the auctioneer at the start of the auction", so
the CAN to conduct the auction was not triggered. No such auction was
initiated, so no such auction exists.

Judged DISMISS (since it refers to "this auction", which has no actual
referent).


Judge Jason's Evidence:

Rule 2545/5 (Power=2)
Auctions

      An auction is a way for entities to give away specified assets
      (items), grouped into lots, in exchange for a currency. A lot is a
      non-empty list of items to be transferred to a single recipient
      (an auction winner).
      
      When the rules authorize a person (the auctioneer) to conduct an
      auction, e CAN do so by any wholly public method that would be
      generally recognizable, as specified by the auctioneer at the
      start of the auction, and under common definitions and terms used
      in auctions, as a fair, equitable, and timely means of determining
      the auction winners from among the current players, and enabling
      the appropriate exchange of goods. Persons who voluntarily
      participate in an auction (including the auctioneer) SHALL NOT
      violate requirements that auction's method that are clearly
      intended to be punishable as rules violations; doing so is the
      Class N Crime of Auction Manipulation, where N is the class
      specified in the auction method (or 2 otherwise).
      
      The rule that authorizes the auction further authorizes the
      auctioneer or auction winners to transfer said items as necessary
      to conduct the auction in a manner consistent with the auction
      method. If the authorization is to auction "new" items, it further
      authorizes the creation of said items as per the chosen method.
      The rule that authorizes the auction further authorizes the
      transfer or destruction of currency from persons who have bid
      voluntarily, as specified by the chosen auction method. The
      authorization to conduct the auction does not provide any further
      authorization than that explicitly described in this rule.
      
      The Treasuror is the promulgator for regulations that define
      specific auction methods (i.e. "the default auction method") and
      SHOULD do in order to aid trade and commerce.  For the purposes of
      interpreting auction definitions, such methods are treated as if
      they are defined in this rule. To further aid trade and commerce,
      auction methods should be interpreted in the name of fairness with
      deference to the method's clear intent, if intent can be
      reasonably inferred.
