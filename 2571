==============================  CFJ 2571  ==============================

    If the proposal called Newbie Friendly passes, and someone called
    Joe wished to register, if they said "JOE IZ HARE", that would be
    enough to register in Agora.

Judge ehird's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 2571 FALSE. Even if we apply Goethe's Ã¼ber-liberal "Moron
in a Hurry" interpretation scheme, "JOE IZ HARE" does not
unambiguously convey the intent of wanting to play the game, let alone
register.
