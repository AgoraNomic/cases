                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

Judge:       Chuck
Justices:    General Chaos (S), Andre (C), elJefe (J)

History:
  Called by Morendil, 08 Sep 1997, 08:55 +0200
  Assigned to Chuck, 08 Sep 1997, 11:29 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged TRUE by Chuck, 14 Sep 1997, 16:11 CDT
  Appealed by Oerjan, 16 Sep 1997, 20:15 +0200 (MET DST)
  Appealed by Crito, 16 Sep 1997, 15:16 EDT
  Appealed by General Chaos, 16 Sep 1997, 16:00 -0500
  Assigned to General Chaos, Andre and elJefe as Justices, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

======================================================================\

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.
