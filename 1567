==============================  CFJ 1567  ==============================

    If Sherlock has a One Share card, then Goethe errored in good faith
    in determining the cards to deal, and the errors did not greatly
    change the probability of the cards that were selected.

Caller's Arguments:

The recent "two-state" did not happen to deal any copies of the cards that
have uncertain locations.  Therefore, the deals for the first state are
correct for the first gamestate, and the deals for the first state would only
be slightly incorrect in probability if applied to the second gamestate.
Therefore, the first gamestate's deals should be treated as the actual deals
in either gamestate: they are absolutely correct in the first gamestate, and
should be allowable by the last paragraph of 2069 in the second gamestate (the
gamestate in which Sherlock has a One Share card).  A judgement of TRUE would
allow this interpretation and minimize game splintering.

I have no legal choice, really.  After pondering probabilities, I must do as
follows.

The following five deals are only legal deals in the gamestate in which
Sherlock holds a Discard Picking card:

I deal Dud to The Library
I deal Divide or Conquer Your Stock to The Library
I deal Divide or Conquer Your Stock to The Library
I deal Coalition to The Library
I deal Library Renewal to The Library

The following five deals are only legal deals in the gamestate in which
Sherlock holds a One Share card:

I deal Distrib-u-Matic to The Library
I deal Procedure to The Library
I deal Debate-o-Matic to The Library
I deal Raffle Ticket to The Libary
I deal Divide or Conquer Your Stock to The Library

THE TABLE is OPEN for BUSINESS (both gamestates).

The following five deals are only legal deals in the gamestate in which
Sherlock holds a Discard Picking card:

I deal Instant Punishment to root.
I deal Not Your Turn to Quazie.
I deal Raffle Ticket to root.
I deal Distrib-u-Matic to Quazie.
I deal Divide or Conquer Your Stock to root.

The following five deals are only legal deals in the gamestate in which
Sherlock holds a One Share card:

I deal Debate-o-Matic to root.
I deal Discard Picking to Quazie.
I deal Debate-o-Matic to root.
I deal Absolve-o-matic to Quazie.
I deal Thieves in the Night to root.

Judge Manu's Arguments:

Du fait que les cartes ubiques concernées sont toujours dans le paquet,
je crois que les probabilités des deux états sont très similaires. Si
le deuxième état (One Share) devient le seul et unique état
de jeu, mon opinion est que la situation de cet état sera correct et
valide, particulièrement grâce à la lecture de la règle 2069. Il est
pratiquement impossible de déterminer la différence créée entre les deux
états, nous pouvons donc dire que la donne effectuée plus tôt est
entièrement valide. Mon verdict est donc VRAI, ou TRUE pour les
angliches.
