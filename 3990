Caller's Arguments:

At the time of the infraction, I couldn’t be established by a preponderance
of evidence to have lied. Therefore, it was immediately and automatically
forgiven by rule 2531/16.

Judge G.'s Evidence:

I've confirmed that the given plaintext matches the given hash, with
the minor note for posterity that 'echo' inserts a newline before
hashing (if this is tested using a different platform).


Judge G.'s Arguments:

Looking at this text from R2531/16:

In general, when the rules ask if a fact can be "established" or
"determined" when evaluating a conditional, we have (through
precedent/custom etc.) interpreted the situation like a textbook math
puzzle: can the "typical" Agoran reader, at the moment in time that
the puzzle is set (i.e. using only information generally available to
em at the time the puzzle legally arises) logically solve the puzzle
with some reasonable amount of effort?  This makes perfect sense when
considering playability in a competitive game: in general moves
(i.e.g. by-announcement moves) need to be made in such a way that most
players can respond, plot countermoves, make plans etc. without having
to wait for specialist interpretation, and with reasonable confidence
that most people with the same facts would come to the same
conclusion.  Moreover, we can't allow players to "take back" past
moves by supplying more information (e.g. so that saying after the
fact "I didn't intend to do that" does not void the initial expression
of intent, even if we sincerely believe the actor didn't intend it).

And to be clear, at the moment of the alleged infraction, the
"typical" Agoran did not have sufficient publicly-available
information to establish guilt, if the "establishment" was performed
at that moment in time with no further input, due to the plaintext of
the hash being known only privately (and I assume only by Gaelan).

However, it collides with the metaphor of investigation when
"establish" refers to establishing "criminal" activity, wherein
"evidence-gathering" and interpretation (possibly including the
interpretation of motive) is necessarily after-the-fact of any alleged
crime (pre-investigation being a rather chilling minority report type
of thing).  That collision is pretty evident in the current rules,
where on one hand both investigation and forgiveness are "thoughtful"
actions after the crime and evidence are gathered, which is at odds
with the concept of "automatic" forgiveness as stated.  Further, the
existence of an "investigator" implies that the investigative process
may involve ferreting around by one person (not by every 'typical'
Agoran), with the investigator possibly obtaining private information
during the process which is then presented as part of the findings,
and in that context it is certainly not unreasonable effort to at
least ask for more data as part of determining whether something "can
be established", or to wait a short time to see if further information
develops.

Since it's not rules-text, but instead custom/precedent, that we take
the "math puzzle" view of solving problems, on balance I find that the
idea of "establishing based on evidence" when applied specifically to
criminal matters as currently written in the rules, makes
guilt-establishment based on an instant "snapshot in time" nonsensical
and against common sense; moreover, we do not want to imply that
gathering of evidence, determining motive, etc. are done "pre-crime".
So in this instance in particular, it is not unreasonable effort (a
moment after the crime was committed) to ask Gaelan to provide the
plaintext (or to wait for em to volunteer it) and in fact e did,
proving that e did indeed commit an infraction, and that at the moment
of infraction, it was quite reasonably possible (through a short
amount of waiting) to obtain the needed evidence to establish a
violation to the preponderance of the evidence.  I judge FALSE.
