The purported double creation:

Rule 2350/16 (Power=3)
Proposals
      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes. A player CAN create a proposal by announcement,
      specifying its text and optionally specifying any of the following
      attributes:
      * An associated title.

      * A list of coauthors (which must be persons other than the
        author).

      * An adoption index.

      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
      is created, its text, author, and AI cannot be changed. The author
      (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person who submitted it.

      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.


Caller's Arguments:

Arguments FOR: The rules say I CAN do it, so creating the proposal should
have worked, and the distribution seems fine. There's no inherent inability
to create something that's already been created, and even if there was, the
rules still say you CAN do it which may override that, or maybe there's a
contradiction that arises because of this in the rules in which case the
Proposals rule may or may not take precedence. There's also the issue of
"the following proposal" not actually referring to a proposal, which may
make the "second creation" work as it isn't actually creating the same
proposal twice, but two separate proposals that have the following
attributes listed in the message of creation. I'm mainly calling this CFJ
because I want a more comprehensive argument than the last time this came
up in a CFJ, as that judgement left many points unaddressed, and there was
lengthy discussion afterwards that may be helpful for making this judgement
more complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge G.'s Arguments:

"Create" in the context of a game object means to bring into being
something that doesn't exist.  For example, in R105/22, the "enactment" of
a rule is described without the use of the word "create".  However, later
in the rule it says:

>      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
>      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
>      a rule or cease to be a rule.

For Rule 105's last paragraph to function, we have to take "create" as a
synonym for "enact", and perform the logical test "does the rule already
exist?  If so it's not an enactment but instead it's a modification".  In
other words, we need to read into R105 the common sense meaning of
"create" so that it's not possible to enact/create an existing rule.  I
think the use of "create" in reasonable common context is strong enough
that, if a rule were to enable the creation of an object that already
existed, it would have to be explicit at redefining the term (e.g. to say
'a X CAN be created even if it already exists' explicitly in the rule and
describe exactly what that means).

This is true for proposals as well.  Any attempt to "create" a proposal by
referencing a previously-created proposal is either (1) a successful
attempt to create a new proposal with the same specified text and other
properties as the original proposal, but still being a unique new
proposal; or (2) a failed attempt to "create" something already created,
because you can't create already-existing things.

Whether a creation attempt falls into (1) or (2) is not an absolute but
rather contextual.  In favor of (1), we generally allow shorthand and/or
obvious intent of saying "I create the following proposal" instead of "I
create a proposal with the following specified properties" so it pays to
be flexible when the author's intent is clear and unambiguous.  However,
in favor of (2), if an explicit context is supplied that confuses the
issue ("I create a proposal that's the same proposal as the following one,
and is not a copy") that's enough to push it to failure, because the
intent required for by-announcement actions is either a different intent
or unclear.

In the quoted message, the caller is clearly setting up a situation where
e intends to try and create the same item twice.  The first attempt
succeeds within our reasonable range of communication[0] (using "the
following proposal" instead of "a proposal with the following text").
However, contextually, the second attempt shows an expressed intent to
"re-create" the original rather than create a copy, so it's not possible
to do so.

Assuming "the proposal referenced above" refers to the entity labeled as
8817 in the quoted test, I find FALSE.
