Caller's Arguments:

1.  The Corporate Bankruptcy card causes Shares cards to be
"returned" to the deck [R1932].

2.  "Returning" cards to the deck is not defined, but any
common definition would involve transferring/moving cards
from their holders to the Deck (the card is not destroyed
and re-created in the deck, as such destruction and creating
is strictly regulated by R2068 (last paragraph).

3.  Transferring is not explicitly defined except to say
that gamblers may do it [R2069.III.a] so the common
definition of "transfer" in terms of changing possession,
transferring, or moving of a thing from one entity to
another should be used.

4.  R2069.III.a. states "Discarding a Card is synonymous
with transfering said Card to The Deck."

5.  Therefore, discarding a card should also be synonymous
with common sense synonyms of "transfer to the deck", and,
in context, "return to the deck" as used in Corporate Bankruptcy
is a reasonable synonym for "transfer to the deck."

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 2068/1 (Power=1)
The Deckmastor

      The Deckmastor is an office which acts as the recordkeepor for
      Cards. The Deckmastor's Weekly Report shall contain a record of
      all Cards in existence and what entity possesses each Card.

      The Deckmastor shall have a budget containing the Maximum Hand
      Size and the Minimum Hand Size, each of which is a positive
      integer between 2 and 10, with the Minimum being less than the
      Maximum. In the absence of a budget, the Maximum Hand Size shall
      be 5 and the Minimum Hand Size shall be 2.

      The Deck is a Gambler. The Deckmastor shall be the sole Executor
      of The Deck, but may take no action on behalf of The Deck except
      as explicitly permitted by the Rules. The Deck may not transfer
      Cards to any other entity except as explicitly required by the
      Rules.

      Only the Deckmastor may create or destroy Cards, and e may do if
      and only if the Rules require it by announcing the Card being
      created or destroyed and the entity who either possesses it now
      or possessed it at the time of destruction as appropriate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2069/2 (Power=1)
Card Definitions

      I. Possession

      Cards may be possessed by Gamblers. All Players are Gamblers.
      If at any time a Card is not possessed by a Gambler, it
      immediately and automatically returns to the possession of The
      Deck.

      The Gambler that possesses a Card is that Card's Holder and
      Holds that Card. All Cards possessed by a particular Gambler are
      collectively referred to as that Gambler's Hand. A Gambler's
      Hand Size is the number of Cards in eir Hand plus one for each
      Pending Draw for that Gambler.

      II. Definitions

      The Rules may define a Class of Card by specifying a Caption, a
      Quota, zero or more Elements, and zero or more Exploits. All
      Cards of the same Class shall be identical and fungible. Each
      individual instance of a Card shall be considered to be a Copy
      of that Class of Card.

      (a) The Caption shall be the name of a particular Class of
          Cards. No two Classes of Cards shall have the same Caption.

      (b) The Quota shall be a non-negative integer. If at any time
          fewer Copies of a Class of Cards exist than its Quota, then
          the Deckmastor shall create a Copy of that Card in the
          possession of The Deck. If at any time more Copies of a
          Class of Cards exist than its Quota, then the Deckmastor
          shall destroy a Copy of that Card in the possession of The
          Deck, unless no such Copies exist, in which case the
          Deckmastor shall destroy a random Copy.

      (c) The Rules may define Elements for Cards. Each Element shall
          have a name and a description. Any Card possessing the
          Element of that name shall behave according to the
          description associated with that Element. An Element not
          defined in the Rules has no effect.

      (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
          only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
          meets the requirements and/or pays the costs outlined in
          that Exploit. Any reference to "you," "your" or a similar
          pronoun in the text of an Exploit refers to the Holder of
          that Card. Taking an action described in an Exploit is known
          as Playing the Card. Unless a Rule says otherwise, a Card is
          automatically transferred to The Deck immediately after
          being Played.

      III. Actions

      No action involving Cards may be simultaneous with any other
      action. No such action may be performed more than once
      simultaneously. If any attempt is made to perform more than one
      such action in such a way that the order of said actions is
      unclear, all such actions fail.

      (a) Unless restricted from doing so by the rules, any Gambler
          possessing a Card may transfer that Card to any other
          Gambler by announcing which Card is to be transferred and
          the Gambler it shall be transferred to. All such transfers
          take place at the time they are announced.

          Discarding a Card is synonymous with transfering said Card
          to The Deck.

      (b) Drawing a Card and Drawing from The Deck are synonymous.

          When a Gambler Draws a Card, the Deckmastor shall be
          required to randomly select one Card from among those
          currently in The Deck's Hand and transfer it to that Gambler
          as soon as possible. Until this transfer takes place, that
          Gambler is said to have one Pending Draw for each such
          transfer the Deckmastor is required to make, but has not yet
          made.

          A Gambler may Draw from The Deck for a Fee equal to the
          number of times that Gambler has previously Drawn from the
          Deck during the current month so long as the Gambler's Hand
          Size is smaller than the Maximum Hand Size plus the number
          of Offices e holds.  For the purposes of this Rule, the
          Speakership is considered an office.

          If the Deckmastor errs, in good faith, in selecting a
          particular card to deal, and that error does not greatly
          change the probability of selecting that card, that deal
          shall be allowed to stand.

Excerpt from Rule 1932/8 (Power=2)
Shareholders and the Corporation

      * Caption: Corporate Bankruptcy
        Quota: 1
        Elements: Limited [Shareholders] [3]
        Exploit: For a fee of 3 kudos, all Stock Cards are returned
          to the Deck.

Judge Riail's Arguments:

As Goethe stated in his caller's arguments, the common definitions for
'return' and 'transfer' apply despite the fact that neither are
explicitly defined in the Rules.
