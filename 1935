Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

I allege that the alleged act occurred at least 200 days before the
quoted criminal case was initiated.

Disclaimer: This is just an allegation, it is not necessarily true.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

      * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act allegedly occurred
        at least 200 days before the case was initiated

My arguments for the defense are that, seeing as I alleged that the
act occured at least 200 days before the case was initiated,
OVERLOOKED is appropriate (whether it actually occurred at that time
is irrelevant).

Of course, the clause is obviously intended to be interpreted such
that the allegation is the initiator's.  So I don't have any real
defense other than that I don't think asserting my rights is a very
good ground for EXILE, it seems a little harsh.  I mean, I'm not the
only one who violated that equation.

========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

Unfortunately, comex's gratuitous arguments appear to be correct. This is a
blatant scam, but I can't see how it violates the rules.

========================================================================

Appellant ais523's Arguments:

Although my judgement is currently correct, it ought not to be. Using the
appeals process has the potential to delay a remanded or reassigned judgement
until after OVERLOOKED has been fixed. (Note that when appealing my own
judgement in this way, I believe that I'm skirting around the intention of
Rule 911; but in my view, it's appropriate to use one scam to fix another.)

However, just because comex has wriggled out of CFJ 1935, for now, doesn't
mean that I can't take actions to punish comex; I merely have to punish comex
by taking actions I could take anyway regardless of being assigned as a judge
in a CFJ. Therefore, to punish comex, I will explain the scam that comex
mentioned to me, and that I mentioned to Wooble earlier (and which e mentioned
in a-d earlier), as I understand it (disclaimer: I may have misunderstood
comex's intent, or worked out some details myself that comex omitted). (I am
not sure if rule 101 prevents comex being further punished for the actions of
eirs which were the subject of CFJ 1935, by the way; that might be the subject
of an interesting CFJ.) As I understand the scam: The scam requires 3
senators, who call an emergency session, then filibuster every proposal just
before its voting period ends, so that there is no time for anyone else to
unfilibuster it. Because proposals take more than 48 hours to enact, the scam
intends that the senators can keep this up indefinitely, preventing any
proposals going through ever; the purpose is to hold Agora to ransom, saying
that the only way that they'll end this is if everyone votes FOR a specified
proposal (that would, for instance, allow the scamsters to win, or benefit
them in some other way). I will also point out that as far as I can tell, the
scam fails if 5 Senators band together to stop it, because they can filibuster
and unfilibuster all proposals themselves preemptively to stop them being
filibustered later.
