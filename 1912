Caller's Arguments:

Rule 2150 says

      An entity is
      a person if and only if it is defined to be so by rules with
      power 2 or greater.

Rule 2166 generally allows me to create persons *in general* by
announcement.  There are already persons I could theoretically make by
announcement, such as partnerships, but that is only a restricted
subclass of persons.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

Rule 2166's "generally" is superseded by the specific type of asset in
question; biological persons exist independently of the rules, and
cannot be created by announcement.  The only other type of person is
partnerships, but comex's announcement failed to create one of those.
