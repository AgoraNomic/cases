Caller's Arguments:

OscarMeyr's announcement of papal succession violated the conditions
specified in rule 786.  However, that rule does not appear to specify
what happens if an announcement is made incorrectly (probably a bug).
The conclave is concluded whether an announcement is made according to
provision (b) (empty club) or provision (c) (nonempty club).

I think that rule 786 should be read as empowering the ADoP to make a
player a pope by announcement, but requiring em to do so only when
that player is in the cardinal club and has at least as much support
as any other member of that club.  If this reading is correct, then
OscarMeyr has made emself pope regardless of whether e was a cardinal.

Now, rule 402 says that whenever a pope is not a cardinal, e ceases
being a pope.  But it also says that whenever a valid notice of papal
succession is published, the current Speaker ceases being Speaker,
then the named pope becomes Speaker, then that pope ceases to be a
pope.

I think that the sequence of events in this case is as follows.  Note
that I am heavily anthropomorphizing here; I think my conclusions are
still correct.

      1. OscarMeyr publishes the notice.
      2. The announcement makes em a pope by rule 786.
      3. Simultaneously:
         3.1. Rule 402 tries to make em stop being a pope, because
              e are the ADoP.
         3.2. Rule 402 recognizes that the notice of papal succession
              is valid, because it was published by the ADoP and the
              player named in it is a pope.
      4. Hence Rule 402 simultaneously does the following:
         4.1. It makes em stop being a pope (but it remembers who e
              is).
         4.2. It makes the current Speaker cease to be Speaker.
      5. "The pope" (i.e., the person named in the notice of papal
         succession) becomes the Speaker.
      6. Rule 402 tries to make "the pope" cease being a pope, but
         fails because that person is no longer a pope.

Caller's Evidence:

1.  OscarMeyr's announcement concluding the conclave
2.  Rule 402/12 (Power=1) Church and State
3.  Rule 786/14 (Power=1) Default Procedure for Conclaves

1.

OscarMeyr's announcement is available online at

      http://www.agoranomic.org/pipermail/agora-business/2005-June/005055.html

and is included by reference.

2.

Rule 402/12 (Power=1)
Church and State

      A cardinal is an active, ready player who is neither the current
      Speaker nor the Associate Director of Personnel.

      While there is a pope, no other player may become a pope.
      Whenever a pope is not a cardinal, e ceases being a pope.

      A notice of papal succession declares that a specified player is
      a pope.  The notice is valid only if it is published by the
      Associate Director of Personnel and the specified player is
      indeed a pope.

      Upon publication of a valid notice of papal succession, the
      current Speaker ceases to be Speaker, the pope becomes the new
      Speaker, and the pope ceases to be a pope.

3.

Rule 786/14 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Conclaves

      When the rules require that a conclave be convened, and no
      competing conclave is currently convened, then as soon as
      possible, the Associate Director of Personnel (ADoP) shall
      announce that e convenes a conclave, specifying a collection of
      cardinals and indicating that those cardinals are to convene a
      conclave.  Provided that:

      (a) the rules require that the conclave be convened;

      (b) no competing conclave is currently convened; and

      (c) the collection consists of qualified cardinals,

      then as of such an announcement, a conclave consisting of the
      qualified cardinals is convened.  A cardinal is qualified for a
      conclave unless the rules specify otherwise.

      The first seven days following the convening of a conclave
      constitute the posturing period.  During the posturing period, a
      qualified cardinal may announce eir intent to become a pope.
      Any other player may publicly support or revoke support for a
      cardinal's claim until the posturing period ends.

      As soon as possible after the posturing period ends, the ADoP
      shall perform the following actions in order:

      (a) E shall determine the cardinal club, which is the collection
          of qualified cardinals with positive support from the
          populace and at least as much unwithdrawn support as any
          other qualified cardinal.

      (b) If the cardinal club has no members, e shall announce this
          fact, and announce the conclave was inconclusive.

      (c) If the cardinal club has at least one member, e shall select
          one of its members to be pope, then publish the list of
          members of the cardinal club, indicating which member is to
          become a pope.  That member becomes a pope as of this
          announcement.

      The ADoP's announcement in (b) or (c) concludes the conclave.
      If the conclave was inconclusive, eir announcement of this fact
      shall constitute a valid call to conclave.  If the conclave has
      not concluded within a fortnight from the time it was convened,
      any player may announce that it is inconclusive; upon such an
      announcement, the conclave shall conclude with an inconclusive
      result, and a conclave must be convened.

      If the office of ADoP is ever vacant, or the identity of its
      holder cannot be determined with reasonable certainty, then the
      first player who announces that e convenes a conclave, with eir
      announcement adhering to the conditions for the ADoP's
      announcement, shall then be permitted and required to perform
      the actions that would have been required of the ADoP for that
      conclave.

Judge G.'s Arguments:

The caller claims that the following to events occured:

>       1. OscarMeyr publishes the notice.
>       2. The announcement makes em a pope by rule 786.

If the announcement did not in fact make OscarMeyr a pope, then the rest of
the caller's arguments are irrelevant and the correct judgement would be
false.

The paragraph of R786 that allegedly enabled the ADoP's announcement to make
OscarMeyr a pope is:
       (c) If the cardinal club has at least one member, [the
           ADoP] shall select one of its members to be pope, then
           publish the list of members of the cardinal club,
           indicating which member is to become a pope.  That member
           becomes a pope as of this announcement.
OscarMeyr was not in fact a member of the Cardinal Club eir name was
indicated, by the ADoP's announcement, as the one selected (this fact is
undisputed).  Did the announcement make OscarMeyr a pope anyway, as the caller
contends?

No.  The Wholly Beneficient and Majesterial Wisdom that is This Court opines
that if the ADoP makes an announcement, but selects/ indicates an entity that
is not a member of the cardinal club, then the announcement does not meet the
minimum requirements of "selecting one of [the cardinal club's] members" and
"indicating which member [of the cardinal club] is to become pope" that would
cause the announcement to be treated as a pope-making instrument.

The Wholly Beneficient and Majesterial &tc. therefore finds:  FALSE.
