Statement: 

The Move of the Vizier of Reform Group transferring Coins in 
response to the purchase request made by TAL in his message dated 
Thu, 13 Apr 95 17:37:33 SET, is illegal.

Barred: Kelly, TAL

Requested Injunction:

If this CFJ is judged TRUE, I request that the Judge issue an Injunction
specifying that the transfer be retracted and that the most recent
representation to TAL of his Reform Group Coin holding be adjusted to
reflect the retraction of this transfer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

The relevant section of the Reform Group Ordinances in effect at the
time of the Move in question is Ordinance 16.  This Ordinance contains
the sentence "The Vizier shall permit Players to purchase Coins of the
Group from the Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of
Exchange, plus the current Reform Service Fee, if that Player is not a
current member of Reform," which clearly specifies that members of
Reform, such as TAL, may not purchase Coins of the Group from the Group
in exchange for Points.  The Vizier of Reform Group is required to not
honor this purchase request by Rule 721, which requires eim to obey the
Ordinances of the Group of which e is a member.

Note that an injunction to correct the report of Coin holdings is
allowed, since that report is a "publication of game state" regardless
of it not being a report of an Officer or being reported to all Players.

Why, thank you.
This seems to be a classic case of the threat being worse than the
execution.

Dear Scorekeepor,
now that ElJefe dissolved the NMC:
please register the transfer of 10.1 points from the MAC Contestfund
to TAL. Signed: the MAC Contestmaster.

Dear Scorekeepor,
please transfer all TAL's points to the Reform Treasury in exchange
for the corresponding number of Reform Coins.
Signed: TAL

Reform Group Ordinances   (March 13, 1995)
Last Ordinance changed: 16

0.
      The Purpose of this Group is to facilitate progressive change
      and dynamic growth within the Game of Agora Nomic, while also
      striving to insure the continuity and playability of the same.

1.
      In all matters which require the Consent of the Membership, the
      Vizier shall announce the Matter in the Group's Public Forum,
      and all Members shall indicate their opinion to the Vizier as
      soon as reasonably possible.  Consent of the Membership is
      defined as at least two-thirds of the Members in favor of the
      matter at hand.  The matter shall not be resolved until either
      seven days have passed from the Vizier's announcement, or
      matters are such that no possible response from those Members
      who have not yet responded could result in a change in the
      consensus opinion.  If, after seven days, less than two-thirds
      of the Membership has responded at all, the consensus shall be
      that the Membership is silently opposed.

2.
      The Ordinances shall have the power to bind the Active Members
      of the Group to cast their individual Votes on Proposals in a
      manner determined by the Ordinances.  In the event that the
      Ordinances do bind the Membership to Vote upon a Proposal in a
      specified way, no Member may cast a Vote on that Proposal which
      is not in concord with this binding; however, a Member may
      always choose to not Vote upon a given Proposal.

3.
      On each Proposal distributed by the Speaker, the Vizier shall
      seek to determine the consensus opinion of the Group of how the
      Membership of the Group shall vote.  Each Member may express
      exactly one of the options specified below, or may indicate that
      e has no opinion; if any of these options is favored by at least
      two-thirds of those Members expressing an opinion, the
      Membership shall be bound by the terms of that option, provided
      that at least two-thirds of the Membership has responded at all
      prior to the end of the Voting Period for that Proposal.  If no
      consensus of opinion is reached by the time that 24 hours remain
      of the Voting Period of a Proposal, then the Membership shall be
      free to Vote as they are individually inclined on that Proposal.

      The options are:
      * to vote FOR the Proposal;
      * to Vote AGAINST the Proposal;
      * to ABSTAIN on the Proposal;
      * to allow the Members to vote however they please on that
        Proposal (UNBOUND);
      * to direct the Vizier to solicit bids from the Electorate at
        large for the privilege of designating the manner in which the
        Group Members shall be bound to Vote (SOLD).

      When the consensus opinion of the Group on a specific Proposal
      is to offer the Group's Votes up for sale, the Vizier shall post
      an announcement to all Active Players advising them that the
      Membership of the Group offers its votes on that Proposal to the
      Player who bids the largest number of the Coin of the Group for
      that privilege.  Members of the Reform Group may not enter bids
      in the sale of the Group's votes, nor may any Player who has
      been a Member of the Reform Group during the 7 days previous to
      the time the auction is announced.  The Vizier shall then accept
      bids until 48 hours prior to the end of the Voting Period on
      that Proposal.  The Vizier shall, at that time, notify the
      highest bidder, if there is one, that e has won the auction.  If
      that Player, before the end of the Voting Period on that
      Proposal, both transfers eir bid, in the Coin of the Group, to
      the Group Treasury, and also specifies to the Membership how e
      wishes it to Vote, the Membership shall be bound to Vote in the
      manner specified by that Player.  Otherwise the Membership shall
      be free to Vote however they please.

      Any time Coins of the Group are transferred to the Group
      treasury as a result of this Ordinance, one half of those Coins,
      rounded up, shall be distributed as evenly as possible among the
      active members of the Group; the remainder, along with any
      fraction unable to be evenly distributed, shall be destroyed.

4.
      The Vizier may expend Points or Currencies held in the Group's
      Treasury for any purpose, but only as specified in the
      Ordinances or with the Consent of the Membership.

5.
      New Members may be admitted to the Group with the consent of the
      Membership.  The Name of a New Member shall be added to the
      bottom of the List of Members.

6.
      An existing Member may be expelled from the Group with the
      consent of the Membership.  For the purpose of determining the
      Consent of the Membership in a matter of expulsion, the Member
      being considered for expulsion shall have no voice.

7.
      Whenever a Member leaves the Group for any reason, eir name
      shall be removed from the List of Members.

8.
      A Member may, at any time, request that eir name be moved to the
      bottom of the List of Members.

9.
      The Vizier may, at any time, nominate another Member as eir
      nominated successor, who shall become Vizier in the event of a
      vacancy, and may retract any such nomination at any time.  All
      such nominations and retractions shall be made to the Group's
      Public Forum.

10.
      The Vizier may resign as Vizier at any time, with or without
      leaving the Group.  Should the Vizier resign without nominating
      a successor, e shall be expelled from the Group.

11.
      In the event that the Group might otherwise have no Vizier, the
      Vizier's nominated successor shall become Vizier.  If there is
      no nominated successor, or the nominated successor is
      ineligible, the first Member on the List of Members shall become
      Vizier.  If there is no such Member, the Group shall be
      dissolved.

12.
      The Vizier shall, in addition to eir other duties, maintain a
      record of the nominated successors to all Group Offices, and
      maintain the List of Members in the order required by these
      Ordinances, and make this information available to any Member
      upon request.

13.
      The Vizier shall, at all times, be the Ordinancekeepor.

14.
      These Ordinances may be changed only with the consent of the
      Membership.  No change in the Ordinances can have a retroactive
      effect, nor cause any action already performed by a member of
      the Group to become void or illegal under the Ordinances or the
      Rules.

15.
      The Vizier may create or destroy Coins of the Group at any time
      for any purpose, but only as specified in the Ordinances or with
      the Consent of the Membership.

16.
      The Vizier shall permit Players to purchase Coins of the Group
      from the Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of
      Exchange, plus the current Reform Service Fee, if that Player is
      not a current member of Reform.  A Player who wishes to purchase
      Coins may do so by transferring a sufficient number of Points to
      the Group Treasury.  When the Scorekeepor has confirmed the
      Point Transfer, the Vizier shall transfer the appropriate number
      of Coins to that Player, creating Coins if necessary.

      The current Reform Service Fee is equal to 5% of the
      transaction, not to be less than 1 Coin, or to exceed 50 Coins.

17.
      The Vizier shall permit Players to sell Coins of the Group back
      to the Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of
      Exchange.  A Player who wishes to sell Coins back to the Group
      may do so by transferring the Coins e wishes to sell to the
      Group Treasury.  The Vizier shall then transfer the appropriate
      number of Points from the Group Treasury to that Player.  The
      transferred Coins shall then be destroyed.

18.
      The Rate of Exchange for Coins of the Group shall be the ratio
      between the number of Coins of the Group in existence (less
      those held in the Group's Treasury) and the number of Points
      held in the Group's Treasury.  This ratio determines the number
      of Coins received in exchange for one Point, or the number of
      Coins needed to receive one Point.

19.
      A Member who leaves the Group for any reason shall not receive
      any share of the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury.

20.
      In the event of the dissolution of the Group, the Treasury shall
      be divided amongst the holders of the Coins of the Group, in
      proportion to the number of Coins held by each Player or other
      Entity.  Coins held by the Treasury are not to be considered in
      this distribution.

========== III. Rule 721

Rule 721/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Ordinances, and Defaults

      All Members of a Group must obey the Ordinances of that Group at
      all times, so long as the Ordinances do not conflict with the
      Rules.

      The Ordinances of a Group may specify:

      1.   how the Ordinances of that Group may be changed, or that
      they may not be changed.  If the Ordinances do not so specify,
      then the Ordinances shall be changed only upon unanimous
      agreement of all Members of that Group.

      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member
      of that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify,
      the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that Group
      was received first by the Registrar, if e is still a Member of
      that Group.

      3.  the Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the
      Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances do
      not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be its
      Ordinancekeepor.

      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

======================================================================

Judgement:  FALSE

	The only problem I had in judging this was whether to judge it 
false, or unknown.  Arguments for judging it unknown are - That I have no 
gurantee to the validity of the Reform Group Ords submitted with this 
call for judgement, and that Reform does not (and is not required to) 
keep any form of records of coin transactions.  I have, however, decided 
to accept the reform group ords as being true - I think the players of 
Agora can be trusted to the extent that at least _one_ member of reform 
would have informed me otherwise.

	I have therefore decided to judge this CFJ FALSE because
	- the exact wording of the ordinance which JonRock objected to is 
"The Vizier shall permit Players to purchase Coins of the Group from the 
Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of Exchange, plus the 
current Reform Service Fee, if that Player is not a current member of 
Reform."

	I don't believe the meaning of this is as clear as JonRock claims 
it is and feel it has two, equally acceptable meanings.  One meaning 
would be that Members of Reform may not purchase coins, the other is that 
members of Reform are not required to pay the Reform Service Fee.  
Therefore, by allowing the transfer but not charging TAL a Service Fee 
(which Kelly tells me is what happened), Kelly and TAL were following the 
Reform ordinances, abeit, a slightly different interpretation of them 
from JonRocks.

	Reform ordinances were followed - therefore, the move was not 
illegal and this CFJ is False.
