==============================  CFJ 1848  ==============================

    Futuremyartug is a player.

Caller:                                 Murphy
Barred:                                 BobTHJ

Judge:                                  Zefram
Judgement:                              FALSE

History:

Called by Murphy:                       21 Dec 2007 16:50:49 GMT
Assigned to Zefram:                     21 Dec 2007 23:25:19 GMT
Judged FALSE by Zefram:                 21 Dec 2007 23:47:17 GMT

Caller's Arguments:

Let D1 be the 24-hour period starting at the time this CFJ was called.
Let D2 be the 24-hour period starting at the time D1 ends.

At some point during D1, I will attend a company Christmas party.  At
some point during D2, I will reveal the official starting and ending
times of this party.  I will then recommend a judgement of either TRUE
or FALSE on the balance of evidence, depending on whether either BobTHJ
or Futuremyartug correctly announced the official starting and ending
times during D1 (they get one try apiece).

========================================================================

Judge Zefram's Arguments:

In the message quoted in evidence, BobTHJ tacitly admits that e does not,
as previously claimed, have access to information sent from the future.
It can be safely concluded that Futuremyartug is nothing but a figment
of eir imagination, and so not eligible to register.

Furthermore, it is the opinion of this court that it is not appropriate
to attempt to contemporaneously adjudicate retroactive actions.  We must
judge, and otherwise run the game, based on the rules that prevail
at the time.  There used to be a clause in rule 101 to this effect;
that has been repealed, but it remains the common-sense position,
just like the obligation to obey the rules (as judged in CFJ 825).
For a real-life equivalent, consider the United States's retroactive
promotion of George Washington to General of the Armies: this does not
mean that e had been wearing the wrong rank insignia during eir career,
nor that military operations and court decisions based on eir contemporary
lower rank were in error.

Either of these arguments, independent of the other, would require that
CFJ 1848 be judged FALSE.  I therefore do so.

|Ha! I was considering calling MKA Systems to ask about Christmas Party
