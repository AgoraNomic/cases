Caller's Arguments:

As opposed to "14 days since the last report".  Rule 1023 does not leave the
matter clear, and common definition leaves both options open, for example "A
fortnight is a unit of time equal to fourteen days (two weeks)."

========================================================================

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

Rule 1023 uses the words "week" and "fortnight" in the same context,
so we can conclude that their meanings are as analogous as possible.
The word "week" could mean either "week-long period" (which can begin
at any time) or "Agoran week" (which only begins at midnight on
Monday). If we assume that "week" means "week-long period", then would
be illegal for an officer to publish eir report, say, on Wednesday one
week but on Thursday the following week (unless e publishes an extra
report in between). Indeed, since it is not feasible for an officer to
produce each report exactly one week after the prior one, this would
amount to a requirement to publish reports strictly more often than
once per week. While some consistency in publication times of reports
is desirable (we wouldn't like it if an officer published a report
just before midnight on Monday, and another just after, and called
that two weeks' worth of reports), I don't think it's reasonable to
require officers to publish reports "strictly more often than once per
week", and so "week" in Rule 2143 must mean "Agoran week".

The two possible interpretations of "fortnight" are "two-week-long
period" and "period consisting of two consecutive Agoran weeks". (In
theory, "period consisting of two consecutive Agoran weeks" is not as
reasonable an interpretation as "Agoran fortnight", i.e. some
hypothetical period of time that only begins once every two weeks;
however, there is no basis for deciding which weeks are "even" weeks
and which weeks are "odd" weeks.) For the sake of consistency, and for
the same reasons as given in the above paragraph, "period consisting
of two consecutive Agoran weeks" is the more reasonable interpretation
here. I judge TRUE.

The consequence of this is that if the Speed is Slow, officers are
required to publish a report this week if and only if they did not
publish a report last week.
