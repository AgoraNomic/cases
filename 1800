    Goethe initiated an Agoran decision in Message-id:
    <Pine.LNX.4.43.0711171811460.2595@hymn12.u.washington.edu>

========================================================================

Caller:                                 Murphy

Caller's Arguments:

We've been accepting "I nominate <player> for <office>" as a gloss
for "I initiate an Agoran decision on whether to approve making

<player> the holder of <office>".  Similarly, we should accept "I
call for the appeal of <judgement>" as a gloss for "I initiate an
Agoran decision on whether to approve appealing <judgement>".

Judge root's Arguments:

In the matter of CFJ 1722, Judge Zefram laid out eight criteria for
successfully initiating an Agoran decision of whether to approve the
action.  The message must:

   a. announce intent to perform a dependent action;
   b. unambiguously describe the action to be performed;
   c. unambiguously describe the method of dependent action;
   d. set forth intent to initiate the Agoran decision;
   e. meet R107's conditions regarding information to be supplied,
      including:

      1. the matter to be decided;
      2. a description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
         enable public agreement on which persons are eligible;
      3. the identity of the vote collector;
      4. any additional information required by the rules for the
         announcement.

Since the time of that judgement, Rule 107 has been amended, adding a
new criterion:

      5. a clear indication of the options available.


Goethe's announcement in the referenced message included the
statement, "I call for appeal of Murphy's latest judgement in CFJ
1787...."  Several of the required elements are not explicitly
included in the announcement; however, CFJs 1650 and 1722 have set the
precedent that these can generally be left implicit.

   a) The announcement clearly purveys intent to perform an action,
      but it does not explicitly indicate that the action to be
      performed is dependent.  However, since appeals in inquiry
      cases such as 1787 can only be performed as dependent actions,
      I find that this is implicit.

   b) The action to be performed is unambiguously the appeal of a
      particular assignment of judgement.

   c) The method of dependent action is not explicitly laid out in
      the announcement; however, only one method is defined for this
      dependent action, so I find that "without two objections" is
      unambiguously implicit.

   d) As in CFJs 1650 and 1722, intent to initiate the Agoran
      decision is not explicitly laid out.  CFJ 1722 has set the
      precedent that this criterion is met if criterion a is met.

   e1) The matter to be decided is the approval of the dependent
       action; this also follows from a).

   e2) CFJs 1650 and 1722 have set the precedent that the class of
       eligible voters is implicit in the nature of the matter to be
       decided, if it is not explicitly described.

   e3) Similarly, the identity of the vote collector has previously
       been found to be implicit in the nature of the matter to be
       decided.

   e4) The rules require no additional information for this type of
       dependent action.

   e5) There is no precedent regarding an implicit description of the
       available options, but I think it is entirely reasonable to
       extend the precedents regarding e2 and e3 to cover this
       criterion as well.
