========================================================================

Panelist OscarMeyr's Arguments:

I find nothing in the Appellant's arguments that significantly alters
the original situation.  I move to SUSTAIN CFJ 1453.

========================================================================

Panelist Manu's Arguments:

I find that the original CFJ 1453 has nothing to do with the current
situation as the three Rules given as evidence do not exist anymore in
the ruleset. Therefore, I can not have a clear opinion on the subject
and so I move to SUSTAIN the CFJ 1453. If Goethe feels a precedent
must be made in regards to Contracts and Rulebooks, a new CFJ is in
order.
