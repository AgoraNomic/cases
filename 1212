========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1937 defines how Vacancies in the Oligarchy are filled. It states
that when there is no High Oligarch "The Low Oligarchs select a Middle
Oligarch to become High Oligarch." In May 1 00:00:00 GMT, the monthly
rotation happened (Rule 1938), leaving the seat of High Oligrach open. As
required by Rule 1937, the Low Oligarchs harvel, Michael and t then
announced their selection. Wes was chosen to be the High Oligarch by an
unanimous vote.

Unfortunately, Rule 1938 doesn't define clearly the precise time when Wes
became the High Oligarch. Three possibilities come to mind:

1) When the required majority has been attained. In this case, this
happened at Wed, 3 May 2000 09:49:12 +0100, as can be seen from the
evidence.

2) When all Low Oligarchs have announced their selection. In this case,
this happened at Wed, 3 May 2000 12:48:35 +0300.

3) After the selection deadline of three days has passed, which in this
case happened at Thu, 4 May 2000 00:00:00 GMT.

In any case, even if 2) or 3) should be found to be true, apparently all
Oligarchs are still required to announce their selections, even if it
would have no effect. This fact does give some support to the statement.
However, the Rule only mentions what should be done when a selection
requiring a majority vote does not have a decisive result, not what
happens when it does.

I attach all three Low Oligarchs' announcement as well as the pertinent
Rule (R1937) as evidence.

I select Wes to become the High Oligarch.

Wes has been chosen to become the High Oligarch, with 3 votes in favor of
em and 0 votes in favor of Elysion. There is now a Middle Oligarch
vacancy.

Now, the question is, whether Wes became the High Oligarch just now or
already when Michael made eir selection which guaranteed that Wes would be
chosen. Doesn't matter in this situation but it might in some other
circumstances. Does anybody want to cfj?

Rule 1937
---------

Rule 1937/0 (Power=2)
Filling Vacancies in the Oligarchy

      Vacancies in the Oligarchy are filled as follows, in order.

      1) If there is no High Oligarch:
         a) The Low Oligarchs select a Middle Oligarch to become High
            Oligarch.
         b) If there are no Low Oligarchs, then the Speaker selects a
            Middle Oligarch to become High Oligarch.
         c) If there are no Middle Oligarchs, then the Speaker selects
            a Low Oligarch to become High Oligarch.
         d) If there are no Middle Oligarchs or Low Oligarchs, then
            the Speaker conducts three Auctions:  one for High
            Oligarch, one for the two Middle Oligarchs, and one for as
            many Low Oligarch positions for which no Auction is
            already in progress.

      2) If a Middle Oligarch position is vacant:
         a) The High Oligarch selects a Low Oligarch to become a
            Middle Oligarch.
         b) If there are no Low Oligarchs, then the High Oligarch
            conducts a single Auction for L+M positions in the
            Oligarchy, where L and M are, respectively, the number of
            vacant Low and Middle Oligarch positions for which no
            Auction is already in progress. The High Oligarch then
            selects M of the new Oligarchs to be Middle Oligarchs.

      3) If a Low Oligarch position is vacant:
         a) The High Oligarch conducts an Auction for the number of
            Low Oligarchy positions for which no Auction is already in
            progress.

      Any selection required by this Rule must be announced within
      three days. A Player may not change eir selection once e has
      announced it.

      A Player required to make selection who fails to do so within
      three days commits the Class 2 Infraction of Oligardiness, which
      any Player may detect and report.

      Selections performed by two or more Oligarchs are by majority vote.
      If a single Oligarch who is required to make a selection fails
      to do so, or if a selection to be performed by majority vote
      does not produce a decisive result within three days, then the
      Oligarchs' selections (if any) are cancelled and the Speaker is
      required to make the selection instead.

========================================================================

Judge Peekee's Arguments:

I hereby Jusge this TRUE.

As wes was selected by the other Oligarchs at such a time when then had all
given their choice.  As described in 2) of the callers arguement.

========================================================================

Judge Elysion's Arguments:

Rule 1937 does not specify when the selection caused Wes to become High
Oligarch. There are three likely
possibilities:

        a) When the selection cannot be changed by further selections by
the remaining Oligarchs

        b) When all Oligarchs have selected

        c) When 3 days have passed

If only 2 Low Oligarchs have selected, and both selected Wes, the third
is still required to make a selection, even though the group selection
is already determined. Thus, the selection process does not end at (a).
Rule 1937 provides for two ways to end the process, (b) and (c)
(whichever occurs first). In this particular case, (b) occurred first.

The relevant phrase of the algorithm is "The Low Oligarchs select a
Middle Oligarch to become High Oligarch." Clearly, after the selection
process is completed and a Middle Oligarch is chosen, e becomes High
Oligarch. Although it could be argued that rule 1937 never says when the
selection causes the Middle Oligarch to become High Oligarch, it is this
judge's opinion that the most reasonable interpretation of rule 1937 is
that the change occurs immediately after the process is completed. I
therefore judge this statement TRUE.
