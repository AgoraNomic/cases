Caller's Arguments:

Arguments FOR: the intent is clear and unambiguous.
(I think this is fairly clear, but Janet has issued a doubt without making
a CFJ and it will come time to decide whether the intent passed or not
eventually.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Janet's Arguments:

Objecting to an intent is a "by announcement" action. Therefore, to
perform it, one must, "clearly and unambiguously", specify the action
and set forth intent to perform it by sending the message. The possible
ambiguity in this case is whether 4st could have meant "oppose" to mean
that e was informally stating eir disapproval to the intent without
formally objecting. In fact, a person who meant to do exactly that could
quite plausibly have written the same thing that 4st did, and, for an
unwary Agoran, it would be a much more natural way to write it than "I
am against, but do not object to, this intent". I find that this is
enough to create ambiguity with respect to whether intent to perform the
action was set forth by sending the message. This causes the purported
to fail.

Having found that intent to perform the action of objecting was not set
forth, I do not reach whether the action itself was sufficiently clearly
specified.

Judged FALSE.


Judge Janet's Evidence:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 478/41 (Power=3)
Fora

      Publicity is a secured forum switch with values Public,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.

      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.

      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. To
      "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
      whose body contains that thing. To do something "publicly" is
      to do that thing within a public message.

      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.

      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified. Allowing actions performed by
      sending a message to take place simultaneously must be done
      explicitly and is secured at power 2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2124/31 (Power=3)
Performing Tabled Actions

      For a given tabled intent, a player CAN, unless otherwise
      forbidden by the rules or the document enabling the action, act on
      eir own behalf, by announcement, to:
      * Become a supporter ("support" it), unless e tabled or previously
        supported it;
      * Become an objector ("object to" it), unless e previously
        objected to it;
      * Cease to be a supporter or objector ("withdraw" support/objection).

      An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the
      Speaker hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, and its
      conditions, if any, are each clearly and unambiguously met.

      An intent is mature if it was tabled at least 4 days ago and
      nobody withdrew objections from it in the past 24 hours.

      A rule purporting to allow a person to perform a tabled action
      allows em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents
      for that action/method combination:
      * With N Support: e is a sponsor or supporter of a ripe intent with
        at least N supporters.
      * Without N Objections: e is a sponsor of a mature ripe intent with
        less than N objectors.
      * With N Agoran Consent: e is a sponsor or supporter of a mature
        ripe intent with supporters greater than N times its objectors
        (e SHOULD list supporters and objectors).
      * With T notice: e is the sponsor of a ripe intent created at
        least T ago.
