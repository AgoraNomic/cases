Caller's Arguments:

The plain text version of the message has atrocious formatting, looking 
like all votes are from the quoted part from 16 October, not new content.

Judge Alexis' Arguments:

The original message is stored in the archives here:

https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-
business/2017-October/036487.html

Note that this page shows the text/plain part by default; the text/html 
portion can be viewed by clicking the link at the bottom, although this 
presents a sanitized version of the page, causing serious encoding issues. 

This case relates to CFJ 3572, where o draws attention to the fact that a 
multipart/alternative message such as ATMunn's must include multiple 
versions of the same information. Based on the logic of that case, it must 
be the case that a player cannot perform an action clearly or 
unambiguously if it differs between parts of a multipart/alternative 
message. Thus, in order for ATMunn's vote change to be valid, it must be 
clear exactly what votes e was changing and how in both the plain text and 
HTML versions of the message.

So what do each say? The HTML version of the message has each of the votes 
at two levels of quoting deep. That is to say, the votes are written so 
that they appear in the quoted message beginning with "Oops".

By contrast, the text/plain version precedes each vote by a mess of 
indentation:

>>>> 7922*  Alexis         3.0  Clarity Act                  Alexis      1 
=AP
>>>
>>> =E2=80=8BFOR=E2=80=8B
>>
>>> 7923*  Gaelan         1.0  Another Economy Fix Attempt  Gaelan      1 
A=P
>>>
>>> AGAINST. I transfer Alexis another shiny (bringing my total up to 2) 
in
>> an obvious bribe, again.
>>

Note the use of the greater-than signs, to indicate levels of quotation. 
Each line containing a vote is preceded by three levels quotation, 
although subsequent lines (including a continuation of the previous line, 
in the second example) are indented by only two.

From a strictly semantic point of view, these messages are not identical. 
The quoting expressed in the plain text portion is different from the HTML 
portion. As a result, this is enough to consider them suspect.

However, evaluating the two messages in context of the outer messages, 
namely "I change my vote as follows:" and the TTttPF around that, it is 
clear that ATMunn's intent is to change eir votes. The only reasonable 
interpretation of the plain-text message is that e is changing eir votes 
to the ones listed; the weird formatting does not change that there is a 
clear list of proposals to be voted on and votes to be cast.  This list of 
votes accords between the plain-text and HTML versions. Consequently, 
ATMunn's message is saved by the fact that the interpretation of eir 
actions---the actual semantic content from the point of view of the game--
-is clear and identical in both versions of the message. If there were, 
say, additional votes being quoted elsewhere in the message, it's quite 
possible that the formatting issues would cause the plain text to become 
unclear and, subsequently, the entire attempt to fail.

Accordingly, I judge TRUE.
