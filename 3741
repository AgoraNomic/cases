Caller's Arguments:

For context, Rance said:

> R2549 says "An Auction also CANNOT be initiated unless the Auctioneer is
> able to give away each item in each of the Auction's lots."
>
> If Agora was unable to transfer the zombie ownership at the time the
> auction was initiated, does that mean the initiation failed in the first
> place?

But I think the initiation worked, because R1885 says "the Registrar
CAN put that zombie ... up for auction", and R1885 has higher power
than R2549. R2549 describes the method for initiating auctions (by
announcement), and R1885 says that the Registrar CAN, so my attempt
satisfied both of the R2125 conditions: "A Regulated Action CAN only
be performed as described by the Rules" and "only using the methods
explicitly specified in the Rules for performing the given action."
The CANNOT that appears later in R2549 that Rance quotes is overruled
by the CAN by the higher-powered R1885.

Caller's Evidence:

From the Registrar's June 6 announcement with subject "June Zombie Auction":

> I initiate a zombie auction, with the following lots (each zombie a
> separate lot) ordered as follows (highest-bid first):
>
> 1. Publius Scribonius Scholasticus
> 2. Corona
> 3. Hālian
> 4. Tarhalindur
>
> Agora is the Auctioneer, and the Registrar is the Announcer. The
> currency is Coins with a minimum bid of 1.

Judge G.'s Arguments

CFJ 3741 is practically identical to CFJs 3693-3694, and no one has
presented explicit counterarguments to the reasoning in those CFJs.
I find TRUE.
