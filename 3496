========================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

The message containing the report reads:
> I hereby deputise for the registrar to publish the weekly Registrar's
> report as follows:
> 
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Registrar's Weekly Report
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
> [...]

The published document clearly claims to be the Registrar's weekly
report and it was published by the holder of the offices, so it seems to
me that it is a report. I judge CFJ 3496 FALSE.

Publius Scribonius Scholasticus's message was misleading about how he
published the report and may have violated this clause in Rule 2143:
> A person SHALL NOT publish information that is inaccurate or
> misleading while performing an official duty, or within a
> document purporting to be part of any person or office's weekly
> or monthly report.
