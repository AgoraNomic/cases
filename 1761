Caller's Arguments:

I suggest legislation clarifying how the general situation (person X
causes non-first-class person Y != X to perform action Z by a method
defined in Y's organizing document) works when

  (a) action Z is publishing something
  (b) X claims to simultaneously perform the action themselves
  (c) both (a) and (b)
  (d) causing Y to act depends on a conditional that evaluates to false

Judge Zefram's Arguments:

The AFO acts by means of its members making appropriate announcements.
The only announcement so made regarding the AFO and this message was
Murphy's opening statement within the message:

|I cause the AFO to publish the following.  I also publish it
|acting as myself.

By means of this statement, the AFO published the information that
followed this paragraph, which was an announcement of the voting results
for proposals 5222-5223.  However, the voting results obviously do not
constitute the entirety of message <46FFFFB9.4070306@socal.rr.com>.
That message, in addition to the voting results, has the opening
paragraph that sets context for the voting results, and headers that
indicate authorship and other matters.

I find that publishing the set of voting results is different from
publishing message <46FFFFB9.4070306@socal.rr.com>.  The AFO did not do
the latter, and so I judge CFJ 1761 FALSE.
