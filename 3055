Judge woggle's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 3055 GUILTY / FINE - 25 points

========================================================================

Request for reconsideration by <function player at 0xb6d4d8b4>:

I intend, with 2 support, to file a motion to reconsider on this
sentence. 25 Points is the maximum possible fine and about 60% of the
total points the CotC is awarded for eir work in a month, so I think
that it is too high.

========================================================================

Judge woggle's Arguments:

I rejudge this GUILTY / FINE - 7 points. (The approximate duration of
the violation is 5 days at approximately 1.5 points/day of CotC salary.)
