Is the "Because..." clause a conditional, or not?

Gratuitous Arguments by Yally:

The structure of my sentence purports that I believed that I was Crown Prince,
and that I therefore took an action. That is I purported something to be true,
and then because I believed it to be true, I took an action. This is distinct
from saying IF something is true, I took an action. If I were not actually
Crown Prince when I said that, then the only thing I accomplished was saying
something untrue.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Wooble:

The judge should consider whether "This fee
should be 0." affects the required announcement that there is a fee in
the case where Yally was not the Crown Prince.  My reading is that
this wording makes it more likely that the move succeeded regardless
of eir initial position; had e intended to move the player above em
iff the fee was 0, e could have made the move by announcement or
specified that e was definitely playing a fee of 0, rather than
speculating that the fee "should be" 0.

========================================================================

Judge omd's Arguments:

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State, I judge FALSE.
