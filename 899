Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

This has been a somewhat difficult Judgement to ponder.  The
Frankenstein Monster is, at best, rather difficult to understand.  But
a systematic review of things proved useful.

There is very little Game Custom regarding the nature of penalties;
all other penalties are either in Blots or Mils, and Blots are meant
to be received while Mils are to be paid out.  Common sense rather
left me in the cold on this one.  As far as I can tell, there are no
past Judgements on the subject.  So then I consider Frankenstein
Monster custom and the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster.  In
general, I think that the Players seem to like the Frankenstein
Monster, and surely it is in its best interests to be liked (since if
it isn't, it will be repealed).  And if the FM is liked, then the
reasonable _penalty_ is to deprive someone of FMs.  Thus, I conclude
that a penalty of 2 Frankenstein Monsters requires the penalized to
lose two Frankenstein Monsters.

Evidence:

Rule 1671/10 (MI=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      There is the Office of Frankenstein Monster.

      Frankenstein Monster Transition occurs when any of the following
      happens:

         i) A new quarter has begun.
        ii) The Frankenstein Monster goes (or is already) On Hold
       iii) The Frankenstein Monster no longer wishes to be
            Frankenstein Monster .

      Once a person possesses a Frankenstein Monster, e shall keep
      that Frankenstein Monster forever.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits an Infraction, to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      2 Frankenstein Monsters.

      A Player is required to perform all actions required of eim by a
      legal Frankenstein Monster within 72 hours of it taking effect,
      unless the Frankenstein Monster is set aside prior to that time.

      An ACO that attempts to form a Frankenstein Monster must
      contain, in addition to any information required elsewhere, a
      specification of the prospective initial Ordinancekeepor and
      Vizier of the Frankenstein Monster to be created.

      A Player casts the Frankenstein Monstr by sending a message to
      the Public Forum clearly and unambiguously identifying the
      Player who is to be the Believer.

      The Registrar shall send a copy of the Frankenstein Monstr to
      any Player who Registers for the first time, within a week of
      such Registration.

      No Frankenstein Monster may have retroactive application.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.
