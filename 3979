Judge ais523's Arguments:

This time, the attempted action was is "5 times, I submit a proposal
with the following attributes:". This is significantly different from
the case of CFJ 3978 because the text of the message no longer states
that the same proposal is being submitted each time (rather, it simply
requires the proposals to have the same attributes). If "submit" and
"create" are synonyms, this clearly works because it's possible to
create five identical proposals, and this is the only sensible reading
of the text; and although it's an "abbreviated message", it would be
possible to write out the non-abbreviated version in the body of an
email, which is the normal test for whether the abbreviation is
allowed.

If "submit" and "create" are not synonyms, this fails due to using the
wrong verb, and thus attempting to take an impossible action. As
explained in my verdict of CFJ 3978, I think that interpreting them as
synonyms is a possible reading of rule 2350, in which case it easily
wins the rule 217 tiebreak. If anyone thinks that this isn't consistent
with the text of the rules, they should probably appeal this CFJ (but
this doesn't affect the verdict of 3978, only 3979).

I judge CFJ 3979 TRUE
