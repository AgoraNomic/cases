Caller's Evidence:

 Bir tane 'Blot'u benden zefer taraftarle, aklama??m ama??m
 size bildiriyorum.
 Zefer taraftarle, ben bir tane 'Blot'u benden aklama??m.
 -Goethe

 I CFJ on the following statement:
   Goethe has successfully absolved 1 Blot from emself this
   Agoran week.

  CotC please use this entire message as evidence.

Now to keep books straight regardless of CFJ outcome:
 One of a number of Blots from me with zero Supporters, my act-of
 absolving intent to you (plural) I am making known.
 Zero supporters-with, one of a number of Blots from me I absolve.
 -Goethe

[Don't blame me.  I didn't start it.]

Judge root's Arguments:

Since I have not acquired a translation of Goethe's Turkish absolution
attempt, I am assuming for the purpose of this judgement that Goethe's
translation later in the same message is accurate.

Now Rule 754/4 states that "Differences in spelling, grammar, or
dialect...are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as
long as there is no ambiguity in meaning."  It is worth noting that many
dialects of the same language are so drastically different that their
speakers have great difficulty understanding one another.  From this
point of view, it seems reasonable that R754 can easily be extended to
differences in language as well.

It should also be noted that Agora has no "official" language.  As such,
the only reason for preferring English messages over messages of other
languages is game custom:  all the (current) players speak (or at least
read and write) English, and game communications have traditionally been
written in English.  This does not seem to be a strong enough reason to
bar non-English communications, especially given R754 as above.

Thus, I find that the language of the message does not render it
ineffective.  The only remaining question as to the message's
effectiveness is whether or not Goethe's use of the "with 0 Support"
construction was successful.  On this issue, I yield to Peekee's judgement
in CFJ 1444, which found that such messages are not ineffective.  As the
most recent Herald's report indicates that Goethe did not perform any other
absolutions that week and that e had at least one Blot at the time, I
find that the absolution was successful and return a judgement of TRUE.
