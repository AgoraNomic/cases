Judge G.'s Arguments:

First, see CFJ 3157 with respect to "used to refer".  A google search
shows only a couple references to the number.  (1) as part of a phone
number and (2) it may refer to Pubchem compound #441344 (Dicyclomine,
C19H36ClNO2).  I do not know if the compound # sees common citation or
if it's a compound in common use; no article turns up focusing on the
use of that number as such a reference in the past 3 months.
