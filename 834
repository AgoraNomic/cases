======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgement:  FALSE

The Statement is about Moves which refer to a random choice, presumably
like the move Wes attempted in transferring a Kudo to a random player.
However, in referring to "any" move the statement requires me to consider
all types of moves that might refer to a random choice, and the statement
is FALSE if it is false for any particular move.

One such type of move is an Officer's act of reporting a random choice made 
under the Rules.  For example, the Rulekeepor's selection of the Virus Number 
(Rule 1454).  Other examples might be the Assessor's selection of a new owner 
for the Potato (Rule 1488), the CotC's selection of a Judge or Justice (Rules 
408, 698, 911, 951, and 1448), and the Registrar's selection of a new Officer 
(Rule 790).

Such a report is a Move, and certainly "refers" to the random choice that 
has been made, and in each case the choice is made by someone other than 
the Speaker.  Rule 494 explicitly excepts itself from influencing these 
situations.  Thus for this class of moves the statement is FALSE.

In general, other types of Moves may or may not require the Speaker to
get involved.  It depends entirely on the language of the Rule which
defines the Move, i.e. whether it requires a random choice to be made 
as an option of the Move, and whether it requires another party to make it.

Considering the Move that may have inspired this CFJ, it seems to me that
the Kudo rule (Rule 1378) refers to a Kudo transfer being made "to Player 
of eir choice."  The Rules seem to require the choice (or "determination") 
to be made not by the Speaker, but by the Player making the transfer.


==========================================================================
Additional Evidence:

Rule 494/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Speaker Makes Random Determinations

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1378/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Kudo Transfers

      In each Nomic Week, each Player not On Hold (the Transferring
      Player) is permitted to transfer a maximum of two Kudos from
      Players of eir choice to other Players of eir choice, subject to
      these restrictions: 1) The Transferring Player is not permitted
      to transfer more than one Kudo from any Player, and is not
      permitted to transfer more than one Kudo to any Player, within
      the Week. 2) The Transferring Player is not permitted to
      transfer Kudos to emself. A Kudo transfer occurs when a Player
      sends to the Herald a legitimate Kudo transfer request,
      including a reason for the transfer.

      Other Rules are permitted to provide for other types of Kudo
      changes.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1454/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Virus

      There is a Nomic Entity called the Virus which has the effect
      of altering the texts of Rules, in the manner and under the
      conditions set out below. This process is known as "infection".
      The effect of the Virus on a Rule, when it has an effect, is
      that of a non-Proposed Amendment to that Rule. Thus, the Virus
      can only be effective inasmuch as it satisfies the Rules for
      the effectiveness of non-Proposed Rule Changes.

      The selection of the Rule to be infected by the Virus occurs as
      follows: as soon as possible after the beginning of each Nomic
      Week, the Rulekeepor shall select a random integer in the range
      [M,N], where M and N are, respectively, the numbers of the
      lowest and highest numbered Rules at the beginning of that
      week. Call a number selected in this way a Virus Number.  If
      the Virus Number selected is the number of a Rule, then that
      Rule is infected as described below, and no further Virus
      Numbers are selected in that week. If the Virus Number is not
      the number of a Rule, then a new Virus Number is selected as
      above, unless five such Virus Numbers (which are not the
      numbers of a Rule) have already been selected in that week. In
      that case, the Virus is ineffective and no Rule is infected in
      that week. 

      The Rulekeepor shall publish the results of the selection
      process in the Public Forum within 24 hours of the completion
      of that process. If a Rule has been infected, e shall announce
      the number of that Rule. If no Rule has been infected, then e
      shall announce that no Rule has been infected.

      An infected Rule is amended in the following way, given that
      other Rules permit it: if the Rule does not already contain the
      sentence "This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not
      contain this sentence.", then that sentence is appended to the
      Rule. If the Rule already contains the sentence, then the
      sentence is deleted from the Rule.

      There is one exception to the above: if this Rule is the
      infected Rule, then this Rule automatically Repeals itself.

Regards,
- elJefe, Judge
