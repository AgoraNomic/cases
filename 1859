Caller's Arguments:

See CFJ 1434.  The relevant portion of CFJ 1769 (If some Rule
requires... if some Rule bases) is unchanged from the time of CFJ 1434
(evidence (2)) to now (evidence (3)).
Evidence:
[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The expiration of a rule-defined
period is an event for the purposes of rule 1769.]
http://cfj.qoid.us/1434

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1769/2 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 17 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins within
      72 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays and the
      time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless this
      would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 17 days in length, in
      which case the first Holiday is extended to 17 days and the
      second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

History:
Created by Proposal 3679 (General Chaos), Jan. 30 1998
Amended(1) by Proposal 4036 (Oerjan), Aug. 7 2000
Amended(2) by Proposal 01-003 (Steve), Feb. 2 2001

Evidence (3):

Rule 1769/5 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time designated as such by the Rules.

      During a Holiday, the Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any
      proposals, and judges SHALL NOT be assigned to any judicial
      case, and judges SHALL NOT assign judgement to any judicial
      question.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January is a Holiday.

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

There are three distinct ways in which a pair of events (in which the
time of the second event is based on the time of the first) can interact
with a holiday:

  1) E1 occurs during a holiday.
  2) E1 occurs before a holiday, E2 would occur during it or within
       3 days after it.
  3) E1 occurs before a holiday, E2 would occur more than 3 days
       after it.

Neither the caller nor the judge of CFJ 1434 clearly specified which of
these cases e was addressing.

A search of other judicial records pertaining to holidays turns up CFJs
1192, 1206, 1424, 1480, 1857 and 1858, but none of these address the
above distinction either.

The "If some rule bases" paragraph of Rule 1769 applies to 1) only.

The "If some rule requires" paragraph of Rule 1769 applies to 1), and
can be interpreted as applying to 2) as well.  This is the situation
on which the validity of root's votes depends.

Rule 683 (Voting on Agoran Decisions) requires votes to be submitted
during the voting period in order to be valid, so the only way for
root's votes to be valid is if Rule 1769's "that action need not be
done" is interpreted as implicitly extending the voting period.  (Rule
1769's precedence claim is trumped by Rule 683's higher Power.)  I
believe this is too far a stretch, as the voting period is the time
limit for five separate activities (cast a vote, retract a vote, veto,
rubberstamp, filibuster).
