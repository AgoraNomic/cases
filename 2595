Caller's Arguments:

A pledge is an entity. Citizenship is an entity switch. A pledge is
also a contract, and as such all its switches have the values its text
states that they have.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 869 (Power=2)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Citizenship is an entity switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the registrar.  A player is
      an entity whose citizenship is Registered.  Changes to
      citizenship are secured.

      The verb "to be registered" means to become a player (i.e., to
      have one's citizenship changed from Unregistered to Registered),
      and the verb "to be deregistered" means to cease to be a player
      (i.e., to have one's citizenship changed from Registered to
      Unregistered).  Where the verb "to register" or "to deregister"
      is used without an explicit direct object, the action is
      implicitly reflexive.

      A first-class person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by announcing that e registers,
      wishes to register, requests registration, or requests
      permission to register.

      A second-class person CAN register with Agoran Consent.

      A player CAN deregister by announcement. A person CANNOT
      register within thirty days after being deregistered by any
      means other than by a mechanism that the rules explicitly
      describe as a means of honorable deregistration.

      A player who is not a person and has never been a first-class
      person CAN be deregistered by any player by announcement.

Rule 2198/5 (Power=2)
Making Contract Changes

      Contract Changes CAN be performed as follows:

        a) By agreement between all parties, if the contract's minimum
           number of parties is at least two.

        b) By a party without objection (any other party CAN object),
           if the contract's minimum number of parties is less than
           two.

        c) Using a mechanism specified by the contract.

        d) By the contract by announcement, if it is a person.

      If a contract does not purport to regulate becoming a party to
      it, then any person CAN become a party to it by announcement.

      If a contract states that one or more of its switches have
      certain values, then they do.

      The rest of this rule notwithstanding, if the nature and/or
      permissibility of a Contract Changes is ambiguous, then it has
      no effect.

      Contract changes are secured.
