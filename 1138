                              CFJ 1138

    Morendil's transfer of one Kudo from Wes to Chuck was invalid due
    to a lack of a valid justification for doing so.

Judgement of FALSE published:        As of this message

=====================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1378/3 states that one of the requirements for transfering a Kudo
from one Player to another is:

      e) the message contains a justification for the transfer.

Morendil's message contained the following phrase, obviously intended
to serve as justification:

for not taking the  time to get  acquainted with the not-so-recently
voted in mechanism  for giving a Kudo without taking one away from
someone else - Honor  without Dishonor -

After an exhaustive search of the most current published Ruleset, we
were unable to discover any Rule titled Honor without Dishonor, and
were unable to discover any means whatsoever of giving a Kudo without
taking one away from someone else. In fact, only 5 Rules even use the
word Kudo (795: Accuracy in Quoting, 1062: Kudos and Honour, 1378:
Kudo Transfers, 1872: Herald's Privilege, and 1008: The Shogun (listed
in the order they appear in the Short Categorized Ruleset). This would
rather strongly indicate that the phrase intended to be justification
for the Kudo transfer is a falsity, as the Rule to which Morendil
refers does not in fact exist.

Furthermore, the word "justification" has a very specific meaning.
According to the Webster's Dictionary, the word is defined: "1a. to
prove or show to be just, right or reasonable. b: to show to have had
a sufficient legal reason." (The other definitions apply to
oathtaking, judging, bail, and text formatting.) Quite obviously, any
fact which proves to be false cannot be "just, right or reasonable"
with regards to a punishment, neither can it be "sufficient legal
reason."

Therefore, we would conclude that Morendil's statement reproduced
above fails to meet the criteria for "justification" and thus Morendil
failed to meet the required qualifications for a Kudo Transfer.

Please note that it is not the purpose of this CFJ to determine
whether a justification must consist of a "good" reason, however that
may be defined, but merely to assert that such a reason may not be
entirely based on statement of fact which is proven to be verifiably
false. We also believe that it is by far in the best interests of the
Game as a whole to judicially exclude "false" from the definition of
"reasonable" and other similar terms.

Judge's Arguments:

rule 1378.e specifies that the transferring message must be contain
a justification, it does not say anything about the validity.  False.
