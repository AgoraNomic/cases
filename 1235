I believe that production, distribution and marketing of panaceas and
other patent medicines are not acts that are of such a nature that they
can be accomplished simply by declaring that you are performing them.

Production and distribution of most panaceas and probably all patent
medicines are also not acts that can be accomplished simply by a message
to an Internet forum.

I note that you have not even mentioned what panaceas or patent titles you
are attempting to produce, distribute or market.  I therefore find it
rather improbable that you have accomplished any of these.

Certainly, you have not shown great skill in the matter.

Your persistence is obvious, but compared to my concept of Quack, not
particularly great.  Your enthusiasm _may_ be a more controversial matter,
but your laziness in pulling this through in a worthy manner would seem to
count against that, as well.

========================================================================

Judge lee's Arguments:

Patent titles are regulated by the Rules, under Rule 649/13 (Power=1),
Rule 1922/0 (Power=1), and others. So if the Patent Title of Quack was
awarded to Peekee, it would have to be as regulated by the rules.  It may
be awarded to any Player who has shown great enthusiasm, persistence, or
skill in the production, distribution, and marketing of panaceas and other
patent medicines.  Right off the bat we can eliminate persistence.  E only
sent the one message concerning them before attempting to award emself the
title.  I also do not see how e has shown great skill or great enthusiasm.
 Although e said he was showing great enthusiasm, that is not all that is
 needed to show enthusiasm.  As anyone who has watched Droopy the Dog can
 attest, saying "I am so happy," need not actually demonstrate happiness at
 all.  Skill, i cannot judge directly, but Peekee wrote repeatedly that e
 attempted various aspects of being the quack. When I show my great skill
 at the things i have _great_ skill at, I don't attempt them, i certainly
 don't write about attempting them, I just do them.  It certainly shows a
 lack of skill in marketing to not even give products a brand name or use a
 catch phase.  E did not even mention what kind of medicines e made.  I
 think e has failed to show the needed skill, persistence, and enthusiasm
 to be awarded the Patent Title of Quack and therefore e was not permitted
 to award emself it.

I hereby show great enthusiasm, and persistence, and skill in the
production, distribution, and marketing of panaceas and other patent
medicines.

I therefore award myself a (regular) Patent title of Quack.

In case that fails it should be noted that if I were indeed a Quack (E.g.
having a (regular) Patent title of Quack) it would make my life a lot
easier
in the production, distribution, and marketing of panaceas and other
patent
medicines.  Thus, even if the first attempt in this message to award
myself
a (regular) Patent title of Quack fails, I believe that it at least shows
that I indeed have shown great enthusiasm in the production, distribution,
and marketing of panaceas and other patent medicines.

I therefore award myself a (regular) Patent title of Quack.

In case both of the above fail,

I hereby attempt to produce some panaceas.
I hereby attempt to produce some other patent medicines.
I hereby attempt to distribute some panaceas.
I hereby attempt to distribute some other patent medicines.
I hereby attempt to market some panaceas.
I hereby attempt to market some other patent medicines.

I believe the above shows that I have shown both great enthusiasm, and
persistence in the production, distribution, and marketing of panaceas and
other patent medicines.

I therefore award myself a (regular) Patent title of Quack.


Would the Scorekeepor please note:
As of this message I believe that I have been awarded a (regular) Patient
title of Quack, therefore as in Rule 1930 "Scoring" I gain 5 Points.

Rule 649/13 (Power=1)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item of recognition of a person's
      distinction.  Only persons may possess Patent Titles.

      As soon as possible after a Patent Title award or revocation
      which occurs automatically occurs, the Herald shall announce
      in a Public Forum that such an award or revocation has occurred,
      and which Title has been awarded to or revoked from which
      person or persons.

      Unless otherwise specified, each Patent Title has Historical
      Significance.  The Herald may, Without Objection, cause that
      Title to lose its Historical Significance.  That Title
      immediately gains Hysterical Significance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1044/6 (Power=1)
Unique Patent Titles

      Each Unique Patent Title is a Patent Title.  If a person is
      awarded a Unique Patent Title, then it shall automatically be
      revoked from any person already holding that Title.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1923/1 (Power=1)
Defined Unique Patent Titles

      The following are Unique Patent Titles:

      (a)  Distributor, which shall be possessed by that person most
           responsible for the maintenance of one or more Public Fora.
           The Registrar may, at eir whim, award this title.

      (b)  Robespierre, which shall automatically be awarded to the
           Player who called for a Revolt, it the Revolt succeeds.

      (c)  Miscreant, which shall automatically be awarded to a Player
           who has at least ten Blots and has a greater number of
           Blots than any other Player, if there is such a Player.  It
           shall automatically be revoked if either condition becomes
           false.

      (d)  Maniac, which shall automatically be awarded to a Player
           submitting an Insane Proposal on which no one votes FOR.

      (e)  Honorless Worm, which shall automatically be awarded to a
           Player who has fewer Kudos than any other Player, if there

           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the perpetrating
           of scams.  This title may not be declined, retracted, or
           revoked.

      (b)  Quack, which may be awarded to any Player who has shown
           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the production,

Rule 101/1 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in

      However, a Player besides the Speaker may always deregister
      rather than continue to play.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
      permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permit it.  Any change to the game state which would
      make it impossible to make arbitrary modifications to the Rules
      by any combination of actions by Players does not occur, any
      Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of
      the first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
      (Immutable) and 201-219 (Mutable).
