Caller's Arguments:

[none]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Judge Jason's Arguments:


Rule 105 says that "When the rules provide that an instrument takes
effect, it can generally [perform rule changes].", and that "This rule
provides the only mechanism by which rules can be created, modified, or
destroyred, or by which an entity can become a rule or cease to be a
rule." Per Rule 1688, persons are not instruments, and they certainly do
not take effect, so the judge of this CFJ has no ability to cause rule
changes.

Judged FALSE.
