The Insulator report has always only listed valid NoVs. Even if the
report did not explicitly state that the NoVs were valid the
announcement was made implicitly: There was no confusion as to which
if any NoVs were valid and which were not. As further evidence, all of
the listed NoVs were assigned ID numbers, which can only be assigned
to valid NoVs.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

My Insulator reports included a list of NoVs with
boilerplate text "valid unless otherwise noted".  BobTHJ's Insulator
reports include a list but omit the boilerplate text; these cases
hinge on whether the judge thinks it can be reasonably inferred.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by BobTHJ:

To add to my 'implicit announcement' argument for the related criminal
cases I'd also like to point out that I have readily explicitly
announced all invalid NoVs during my tenure as Insulator.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

Technically GUILTY, but for the various reasons cited, an APOLOGY
should be sufficient - provided that it isn't phoned in this time.

For today's prescribed-words list, we go to Urban Dictionary for
some noun phrases:

  different hats
  roll call
  bedding the rules
  objectively attractive

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by BobTHJ:

With all the different hats I wear in Agora, one might think that I
was bedding the rules, or that the gods of Agora looked down from on
high, found me objectively attractive, and showered upon me a plethora
of Agoran privilege and blessing - but such is not the case. Though I
may officiate a number of important positions there has been no
special favor shown - on the contrary: Each I must work hard for,
slaving day after day under the weight of great responsibility so that
YOU can enjoy life with a known gamestate. Sometimes I don't know why
I bother. And thus I found myself, that among the roll call of my
endless duties, one had slipped my attention; And though it was clear
what was valid and what not; And though my breach of etiquette slight
- My guilt possibly even non-existant - YOU saw fit to not just slap
my wrist, but to attempt my utter destruction! What a thankful bunch
you are. I feel complete shame and remorse for even associating with
you. I hope someday to rise above petty first-class persons such as
yourselves, but since that time has not yet come I am forced to grovel
in the mire before you - and here to write an apology for what may
possibly have been my only imperfection. I hope you enjoy this now -
because a day is coming when....

...excuse me for a moment while I find some helium to re-inflate my head.
