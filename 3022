Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

At the time scshunt judged CFJ 3011, e had not cashed the promise,
so its time limit did not apply to em.  Interpreting that the
promise retroactively qualified em for the point award is too much
of a stretch, though it might be interpreted that the promise
applied/applies to all judges who could cash it.

Gratuitous Evidence by Murphy:

Message creating the promise in question:

Judge omd's Arguments:

In this case, I've changed my mind:
(1) "within any time limits for doing so" means "within whatever time
limits for doing so exist", thus "within all time limits for doing
so", not "within any time limit for doing so".

(2) Furthermore, a time limit, like any requirement, must exist in the
context of some penalty or system of denoting failure, i.e. a system
of governance.  Whatever the penalty is-- perhaps violation of a
real-life contract, perhaps someone politely pointing out the limit
has been violated or him shooting me-- it essentially resembles an
external jurisdiction, and Agora generally ignores matters of external
jurisdictions.

(3) But even if my promise is considered to assume Agora's
jurisdiction (by analogy with promises' ability to impose certain
obligations, I suppose, as precedent states that the ability to act on
behalf is a type of obligation), by CFJ 2361, the withholding of the
promise's reward for not judging a case within a year is not
considered a penalty because it isn't "certain" that a judge would
"get it anyway"; someone else might cash the promise in the meantime,
or the judge might not want it.  Thus, the time limit for obtaining
the reward is not considered a time limit for judging.

(4) As far as I know, the weakest effect we have ever considered a
penalty is my attempt to register on my birthday being judged
ineffective; and that was a R101 case, where tradition is generally to
interpret the rule as broadly as possible, whereas the author of Judge
Points clearly did not intend it to apply to contracts.  The lack of a
faceless, template note of congratulation is a much weaker effect, and
would not be considered a penalty in any case.
