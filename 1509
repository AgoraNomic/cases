========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

1) "The Deckmastor" Rule:

      The Deckmastor is an office which acts as the recordkeepor for
      Cards. The Deckmastor's Weekly Report shall contain a record of
      all Cards in existence and what entity possesses each Card.

      The Deckmastor shall have a budget containing the Maximum Hand
      Size, which is a positive integer between 3 and 10. In the
      absence of a budget, the Maximum Hand Size shall be 5.

      The Deck is a Gambler. The Deckmastor shall be the sole Executor
      of The Deck, but may take no action on behalf of The Deck except
      as explicitly permitted by the Rules. The Deck may not transfer
      Cards to any other entity except as explicitly required by the
      Rules.

      Only the Deckmastor may create or destroy Cards, and e may do
      if and only if the Rules require it by announcing the Card being
      created or destroyed and the entity who either possesses it now
      or possessed it at the time of destruction as appropriate.

2) Rule 1989 (Prime Executors):

Rule 1989/1 (Power=1)
Prime Executors

      (a) The Prime Executor of an entity with respect to a certain
          action is the Player who is responsible for performing that
          action. For each action that an entity is required to
          perform, there shall be at most one Prime Executor of that
          entity with respect to that action. Any penalty incurred due
          to an entity's failure to perform as required by the Rules
          is incurred by the Prime Executor of that entity.

      (b) Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the Prime
          Executor of an entity with respect to a certain action must
          be an Executor of that entity, or a Limited Executor of that
          entity who is permitted to perform that action on behalf of
          that entity.

      (c) If the Rules designate a Player to be the Prime Executor of
          an entity, without specifying particular actions that the
          Prime Executor is responsible for performing, then that
          Player is the Prime Executor of that entity with respect to
          all actions that the entity is required to perform.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, each Player is eir
          own Prime Executor.

      (e) If a Player is the sole Executor of an entity, then e is the
          Prime Executor of that entity. This provision does not apply
          to a Player who is the sole Limited Executor, but not the
          Executor, of an entity.

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

By the Rule titled "The Deckmastor" and by R1989, the
Deckmastor is the Prime Executor of the Deck with respect to all actions
it is required to perform.  At the time the Deck's requirement to post
"Hot Potato" arose, Goethe was Deckmastor.  Assuming the deadline for
the requirement was 48 hours later, at the time of the deadline Wes was
Deckmastor.  The question is which one of them is the Prime Executor for
this particular action.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

The rules examine the identity of an entity's Prime Executor, not when the
entity becomes required to act, but only when a penalty arises from the
entity's inaction.  (Contrast this to Voting Power.)  I judge CFJ 1509 to
be FALSE.
