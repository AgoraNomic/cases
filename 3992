===============================  CFJ 3992  ===============================

      I have violated regulation "Proposal Style Guide" by not wrapping
      at 80 characters, even though I could have done so by using the
      following shortened URL instead:

      I have not understood the full implications of the action, I have
      also violated rule "The Administrative State."

Judge secretsnail's Arguments:

In both cases, the supposed "violations" are failure to follow "SHOULD" and
"SHOULD NOT" recommendations, which are just that, recommendations, so not
following them wouldn't be a violation. Violation is defined for Rules,
Time Limits, and Auction Method Requirements, in a way that makes violating
a regulated action, that can only be taken as described by the rules, such
as in the definition for "SHALL" and "SHALL NOT".

There's also the clause in Rule 2630 "The Administrative State": "An
officer SHALL NOT violate eir office's administrative regulations in the
discharge of eir office." It's not too relevant to this case, but there may
be an issue when violating a regulation, as violations are a regulated
action that can be performed only using the methods explicitly specified in
the Rules (not regulations) for performing the given action. Rule 2545
(Auctions) handles this nicely: "SHALL NOT violate requirements that
auction's method that are clearly intended to be punishable as rules
violations", the typo aside.

I judge CFJ 3992 FALSE.


Judge secretsnail's Evidence:

Rule 2152/9 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
      rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).

      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID: Attempts to perform
         the described action are unsuccessful.

      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.

      3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL: Failing to perform the described action
         does not violate the rules.

      4. "SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED: Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it ought
         to be be understood and carefully weighed.

      5. CAN, POSSIBLE: Attempts to perform the described action are
         successful.

      6. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rules.

      7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY: Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.

      8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
         described action, the full implications of failing to perform
         it ought to be understood and carefully weighed.


Rule 2125/13 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances
      under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action
      would, as part of its effect, modify information for which some
      player is required to be a recordkeepor.

      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules SHALL NOT be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.
