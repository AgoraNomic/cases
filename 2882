Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

even using the dice server, it is not possible to select
and announce simultaneously.  It would be interesting as a precedent
to ask what sort of delays between selection and announcement make it
still a random process; for example if the herald performs game-relevant
actions between the selection and announcement, does it affect the
process?  -G.

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

This is relevant from CFJ 1460:
   "What matters therefore is not that the outcome [of a random selection]
   could in principle be known in advance, but that (a) in practice it is
   not known in advance,and that (b) the process is known to have the right
   statistical properties in the long run."
A question is whether this "known in advance" is affected by delays
sufficient to impart knowledge to a limited few versus the public
announcement, or to allow others to respond between the selection and
announcement (for example if there's an unofficial announcement of the
selection well-before the official announcement).

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

I judge UNDETERMINED. "Game action" is not defined by the rules of
Agora, so it simply means "action pertaining to the game". Selecting a
random integer and announcing it are definitely actions pertaining to
the game, and whether these two actions form a single super-action is
simply subjective.

Obviously, though, there's still more to be answered: whether ais523
successfully deputized, and whether anyone else can resolve the
rebellion.

I don't recall what the CFJ is, but there was a ruling that declared
that if an officer must perform an action in order to fulfill an
obligation, a deputy is able to perform the action as well. (The
specific case in the case was rotating the bench.) Since the Herald is
required to announce a random integer, it follows that a Deputy Herald
CAN select a random integer for the purpose of announcing it, even
though Rule 2160 may say that the requirement to select a random
integer is already fulfilled. So yes, it's still possible for someone
else to resolve the rebellion.

Even if that reasoning isn't to your liking, there's this. Rule 2270
says, "the Herald SHALL select and announce a random integer between 1
and the number of players in the game." To determine whether the
deputization was successful, we can simply look at the syntax here. We
can say that "SHALL x", for all x, is a single obligation to x; if
this particular clause were two obligations, it would say "SHALL
select and SHALL announce". Thus, ais523 didn't successfully deputize.
