========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

"Recordkeepor" is a rule-defined word, and it is only
defined for assets, so the rules don't define who the recordkeepor of
a contract is.

For non-assets, "recordkeepor" could be considered an alternate
spelling of "recordkeeper". However, rule 754 says that a difference
in spelling is inconsequential "as long as the difference does not
create an ambiguity in meaning", and this difference certainly does
create an ambiguity in meaning: it is ambiguous whether "recordkeepor"
is meant to refer exclusively to the term itself as it is defined by
the rules or also to the actual English word "recordkeeper" as it is
commonly used. Therefore, rule 754 stays out of this, so
"recordkeepor" means "recordkeepor", not "recordkeeper".

Judge ais523's Arguments:

I will take the caller's arguments in turn.

> a contract is.

I've checked the ruleset, and this is correct. Note, however, that rule
2125(e) states
{{{
      e) It would, as part of its effect, modify information for which
         some player is required to be a recordkeepor.  Such an action
         CANNOT modify that information except as allowed by the
         rules.
}}}
which cares about the recordkeepor of information, not the recordkeepor
of assets. There is a bit of a fundamental mismatch here; assets are not
information (although the amount of assets that people hold is). Rule
2166 states that "The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity
defined as such by its backing document."; likewise, other definitions
of recordkeepors define the recordkeepor of an asset, not of information
about it.

The question here is about what "recordkeepor" means in the statement of
the CFJ. A quick Google search shows that the only uses of the word
"recordkeepor" on the Internet are with reference to Agora Nomic. The
Agora definition only seems to exist with respect to assets (rule 2166);
rule 2125(e) therefore appears to be entirely ineffective (this is what
my proposal above was about). As this is the only definition of
"recordkeepor" that exists anywhere, and it seems to be somewhat
different from the english word "recordkeeper", I rule that the two
words are in fact different due to rule 754 (two similarly-spelt words
can have entirely different meanings), and as there are currently no
entities which are both public contracts and assets, all current public
contracts are intrinsically incapable of having a recordkeepor (at
least, with the curent rules). Therefore, there is no recordkeepor of
public contracts (the phrase itself is an oxymoron), and therefore I
judge FALSE.

========================================================================

Appellant omd's Arguments:

I intend to appeal this judgement with 2 support.  If being a
recordkeepor for information is not defined, then it is equivalent to
being a recordkeeper for it.  No Agoran rule attempts to define the
term "recordkeepor".

========================================================================

Appellant woggle's Arguments:

I support this.

Additional arguments:
The judgment makes a distinction between being a "recordkeepor of information
(about X)" and "recordkeepor of X". There is no such distinction, since
records are inherently information.
