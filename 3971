Caller's Arguments:

This basically boils down to whether I can intend to perform a tabled
action, despite it being an action that I personally could not perform
even if I had the required support. There are situations in which one
person can act on a different person's intent (either due to an office
changing hands, or due to the "I support and do so" mechanism), so it
can matter whether the intent is valid even if the stated action isn't
possible.

Historically, I think we've held that intents to perform an impossible
action are valid, and can be made in case, e.g., rule changes make that
action possible in the future, although the action has to be described
precisely enough to make it clear that the intent matches up. This
situation is analogous. (As a side note, rule 2471 has an explicit
exception for intents – this was designed so that a player could table
an intent to perform an action simply so that they'd have the option
available, without planning to actually act on the intent later on,
despite the wording of the announcement.)

However, the rules for tabled actions have changed since the previous
precedents, and they may no longer be applicable; a judge would need to
check the current wording of the rule and see if anything has changed.
In particular, the key to the case seems to be whether "table an intent
to perform a tabled action" permits intents to perform a hypothetical
tabled action, or only tabled actions that are defined in the rules.

For what it's worth, I've been assuming that you can intend to
deactivate someone before they've been inactive for 30 days (e.g.
because you're planning to resolve the intent after the 30-day timer
has expired) – the action that you're intending to perform is an action
that can only be performed in the future, but that's fine because the
your intention is to perform the action in the future, rather than
right now. So "you can only intend to perform an action that you could
(if you had an appropriately ripe intent) perform right now" seems like
it's the wrong reading of the rule. Another possibility is "you can
only intend to perform an action that you could (if you had an
appropriately ripe intent) perform in the future", but that's a future
conditional, and those are almost impossible to resolve correctly (and
in this case, the 14-day ripeness limit is enough time to pass a
proposal to make the action possible, so this sort of future
conditional would hardly exclude anything anyway). So the most
reasonable reading seems, to me, to be "you can intend to perform an
action even if you can't envisage circumstances under which you could
actually perform it".

However, there's a disagreement about this, thus this CFJ.

(The judge might also want to opine on whether the intent in question
could be acted upon, without rules changes, if it's resolved by a
supporter rather than the sponsor – the action of "appoint ais523 as
Speaker" is impossible for ais523 but would be possible for a
hypothetical supporter of the intent. I didn't file a separate CFJ on
this because it was too difficult to come up with a short and loophole-
free statement.)

Judge secretsnail's Arguments [after motion to reconsider]:

"An action is a Tabled Action if it is performed with one of the
      following methods:
      * With N Support, where N is a positive integer.
      * Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer.
      * With N Agoran Consent, where N is a positive integer multiple of
        0.1.
      * With T notice, where T is a time period."

What does it mean for an action to be "performed" with a method?

Rule 478 (Fora) gives a very explicit definition for "by announcement":

Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.

Does such a definition for taking an action "with support" or "without
objection" exist? It would need to exist in order for us to take such
actions, and this section of Rule 2124 (Performing Tabled Actions) seems to
be the definition for what it means to perform a tabled action:

A rule purporting to allow a person to perform a tabled action
      allows em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents
      for that action/method combination:

The rule here allows people to perform a tabled action, which is an action
performed with support, for example, by announcement. The question arises:
are actions taken through this method actually tabled actions? Are they
still performed "with support" or only by announcement?

Let's consider that they are not, that they are just performed by
announcement; no actions would be tabled actions, then, because none of
them are actually performed by a tabled action method. Yet the rules
describe them as being taken "with support", so they ARE tabled actions if
we believe those rules. This interpretation would make the rules
contradict each other, which isn't good for the game, so the alternative
is probably better:

For an action to be performed "with support", for example, is for the
action to be taken by announcement through the "with support" part of Rule
2124 (Performing Tabled Actions)

allows em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents
      for that action/method combination:
      * With N Support: e is a sponsor or supporter of a ripe intent with
        at least N supporters.

That is, fulfilling these requirements in order to take the action by
announcement IS performing the action "with support", making it a tabled
action. The same applies to all tabled action methods.
So what's left to answer is if ais523 tabled an intent to perform a tabled
action. Can an action that is not defined by the rules as able to be taken
with a tabled action method still be a tabled action?
We come back to the question of what it means for an action to be
"performed by" a certain method. When is this evaluated?
Suppose we have an action, X, we CAN take by announcement or CAN take by
another method, let's call it "by floopment". 
Is X performed by announcement?

The answer is, well, that the question is malformed. The action CAN
certainly be performed by announcement. But IS the action performed by 
announcement is an entirely different question. The action could be
performed by announcement, or by floopment, or maybe not performed at all.
Saying the action IS performed by announcement would be a mistake when
there is an alternative, that it ISN'T performed by announcement, that it
HAS NEVER been performed that way but may be at a later date.

So when we are asked "is this action performed with support" the
interpretation should not be "CAN this action be performed with support" as
that is not what is being asked. What is more reasonable to ask "has this
action been performed through this method?"

"An action is a Tabled Action if it is performed with one of the
      following methods:"

This is evaluated when the action is actually performed. Did the action
occur through the method of "with support", or another tabled action method?
Or, you could also ask, would it be?

It's simple to realize that if you were to take an action by announcement,
that action would be performed by announcement. That is, hypothetical
actions taken by announcement can be said to be performed by announcement,
when taken.

The same reasoning can be applied to tabled action methods, letting
hypothetical tabled actions be intended.

Suppose the opposite was true: hypothetical actions don't count, as they
haven't been performed yet by that method. That would still break tabled
actions and be harmful for the game, as no actions would be tabled actions
because no actions have been performed by tabled action methods before they
are performed.

So, hypothetical actions that would be performed by a tabled action method
are tabled actions, whether or not you can actually take them, thus you can
intend to take them even if you actually can't, and ais523's intent to take
a non-rules-defined tabled action succeeded because it would be performed by
a tabled action method if taken.

We should look at the rules for Regulated actions to cover everything,
though:

A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action.


You can make the connection that an action "is performed with a method"
means that action "CAN be performed by that method as described by the
rules", but that seems like a bit of a jump given the wording is
significantly different as argued, "is performed" vs "CAN be performed".

As the rules don't explicitly say that tabled actions have to be
rules-defined to be intended, we shouldn't just assume that's what the
rules mean. We should consider it, but there's no evidence that suggests it
to be true. The lack of an explicit requirement to be rules-defined more
implies that there is no requirement to be rules-defined than there being
one.

Accepting this reading would lead to some consequences: actions would be
tabled or non-tabled based on current, fluctuating circumstances: you must
be X to take this action, you intend to take an action while you are X, but
then become not X... your intent to take a tabled action would no longer be
an intent to take a tabled action, which could lead to some issues. It
should be unambiguous whether an action is tabled, and that can be easily
gotten from evaluating tabled-ness only when the action is actually taken
by some method. We can only tell if an action is performed by a method when
it is performed by that method, as the text suggests. So in intents to
perform tabled actions, all the tabled actions are hypothetical. They may
or may not be performable at the time. This is also supported by only
requiring the specification of "the action" and "the method", and not "the
tabled action". The action does not to be a confirmed tabled action at the
time of the intent, it just needs to be an action that will be tabled when
performed through "the method".

But considering it as an equally valid reading, we should look at the 4
factors from Rule 217. Game custom and previous judgements don't seem too
helpful in the current situation as I can't find any good examples for
custom and previous judgements would also be out of date with the rule
change, though if they did hold that intents to perform impossible actions
could be made in the previous rules, that might favor the "is performed" is
not "CAN be performed" interpretation. For common sense, as ais523 pointed
out, it makes sense to be able to intend to do an action even if you can't
actually do it. Best interest of the game? The "is performed" is not "CAN
be performed" interpretation is more flexible, letting players intend to do
an action that will be available in the future, even if they can't take it
now, which seems good and interesting for the game. So it seems like it
leans to the non-rules-defined tabled action interpretation, and given
there's no outweighing reason to pick the "must be rules-defined"
interpretation, a hypothetical tabled actions allowance is the better way
to judge.

I hold that all tabled actions in intents are hypothetical and that those
intents to perform them can be made, and that tabled actions performed by
announcement through Rule 2124 (Performing Tabled Actions) are still taken
through their respective tabled action methods, in addition to being taken
by announcement. I judge CFJ 3971 TRUE.
