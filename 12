JUDGEMENT 12 (Speaker) Mon, 16 Aug 93, 14:02:53 Pacific Time

   "If, for some reason, the listserv is not operational, and the Speaker
has no reason to believe that this condition will not persist more than a
few hours (defined to be 24 at this time), then it is still within Rule 204
for the Speaker to wait until the listserv is operational again to post any
new Proposals which have been submitted. Of course, if this malfunction lasts
longer than this 24 hour period, then the Speaker then has reason to believe
that the malfunction will persist more than 24 hours."

The Judge for this Statement shall be Alexx <Alexx@std.world.com>, according
to Rule 214. As per Rule 215, Alexx has one week in which to return a
Judgement of TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED, or he shall lose 10 points.

As Alexx has refused the position of Judge, the new Judge for this Statement
shall be Richard M Vickery <ucgbrmv@ucl.ac.uk>, according to Rule 364. As per
Rules 215 and 364, Richard has three days in which to decline the appointment
or one week in which to return a Judgement of TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED, or
he shall lose 10 points.

UNDECIDED

[Reasons: This CFJ hinges (again) on the nature of the
'possible' and also on the specific circumstances of
the Benevolent Speaker.  Delivery mechanisms available
to the Benevolent Speaker are not stipulated, and
faster mechanisms (than waiting up to 24 hours) are
theoretically possible, however whether such
mechanisms fall within the definition of possible made
in the context of Nomic is not decideable in the
general case.]
