==============================  CFJ 1249  ==============================

    The paragraph of Rule 1664 which reads 'The Registar shall select a
    random integer from 1 to the number of Players (plus 1 if Miscreant
    is held) at the time of the Call for Revolt.  If this number is less
    than or equal to the number of Rebellious Players (plus 1 if
    Miscreant is held by a Rebellious Player), then the Revolt succeeds;
    otherwise it fails.' should be interpreted such that, while the
    total number of Players is determined as of the time of the Call for
    Revolt, the number of Rebellious Players is determined as of the
    time the Registrar selects a random integer as described.

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1664/13 (Power=2)
Rebellion

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
      always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch from
      Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding if e has not
      does so during the current month by sending a message to the
      Public Forum saying e does change so. The Registrar shall
      include in the Registrar's Report a list of all Players that are
      Rebellious.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that
            week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the Public
      Forum.

      The Registar shall select a random integer from 1 to the number
      of Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held) at the time of the Call
      for Revolt.  If this number is less than or equal to the number
      of Rebellious Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held by a
      Rebellious Player), then the Revolt succeeds; otherwise it
      fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in
      order):

         - The Registrar shall expunge all Blots of each Rebellious
           Player.
         - The Registrar shall pay out 40 Stems to each Rebellious
           Player.
         - All positions in the Oligarchy become vacant.
         - All Abiding Players that hold one or more Offices in the
           normal fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and
           hold them temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again
         - The Herald is empowered and required to levy a tax of
           75% on indulgences. The holder of the Patent Title
           "Robespierre" is exempt from this tax, even if other rules
           don't allow tax exemptions.
         - A Speaker Transition occurs

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall notify the Herald of all Blots that have
      been gained or expunged as a result of this Rule.

Judge Peekee's Arguments:

Although the second sentence does not state when the number of Rebellious
Players is to be calculated, it refers to the number selected by the
Registrar at the time of the Call for Revolt.  I think that as no time is
given the Registrar should compare the selected number to the number of
Rebellious Players at the time e selects the number, and as such the number
of Rebellious Players should be calculated at the time of such a comparison
the CFJ is TRUE.
