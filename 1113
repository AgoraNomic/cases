==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The first submission of the proposal failed because the email with the
proposal did not reach the public forum, it seems.

Now Morendil and Scott argue that Morendil effectively submitted the
proposal when e later sent a mail to the PF (successfully) that quoted
the full text of the original mail in which Morendil had tried to (but
failed) to submit the proposal. This second mail, quoting the first,
is seen as a valid submission.

I disagree, and don't think that Morendil's (re-)post of the proposal
was a submission. The repost contained the text of the proposal marked
clearly as a quotation of an earlier email document, and the intent of
the repost containing the proposal text was to provide evidence that
the proposal had already been properly submitted earlier. So I do not
think the text reposted by Morendil was delivered "with the clear
indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal", and
therefore it was not a proposal as defined in R1483.

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I hereby return a Judgement of TRUE.

In my opinion, Morendil's quoting of the message by which he attempted
to submit the Proposal does not constitute a Proposal.  The text was
clearly quoted for purposes of making clear what message he was
referring to as having not made it to the PF.  Thus it fails to meet the
requirements of R1483 as there was no "clear indication that that text
is intended to become a Proposal."

Hmm... not. This is a COE; I sent the following, but apparently it

----- 2. Rule 1483/4

Rule 1483/4 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.
