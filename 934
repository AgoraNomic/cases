======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

Argument is the old saw, "Just because it's permitted doesn't mean
it's possible", specifically in this case the fact that there is a
well-defined procedure in the Rules for granting initial Names to
Currencies created under the aegis of Rule 1722, but no procedure
exists to change these inital Names.

I further reject the arguments that Currencies legally minted under
the provisions of Rule 1722 are not Nomic Properties under the
definition of Rule 1011, in that the property of being named "Payment
Order" and so on is granted to the Entities thus created by Rule 1576,
which requires that all Currencies must have a Name, as the Caller
justly notes, and by Rule 1722, which I interpret as, by implication,
requiring that the name of such a Currency be that which is specified
in the message which purports to create it.

To reason otherwise would lead to a pitfall. If we interpret Rule 1722
as *not* requiring that the specific values of properties attached to
a Currency be those specified in the creating message, but merely
attaching particular conditions to the message which effects the
minting a Currency, which conditions would then be irrelevant to the
actual values of the corresponding properties in the newly created
Currency, then we are left with a Currency which either does not have
any of those properties (and thus cannot legally exist) or for which
the value of those properties is indeterminate, which I find
abhorrent, especially as the same fate must befall *all* Currencies so
created.

(Caller's) Arguments:

Evidence and arguments: See my message of 30.07.97 to the public
forum (attached).

Relevant rules: 116, 1011, 1576. (And, in principle, the other rules
pertaining to the creation of currencies, their properties and the
mintor's and recordkeepor's duties and abilities.)

----Att. 1: Message of 12.07.97 to the public forum (from Morendil)

[header snipped to avoid confusing mail readers]

H. Chancellor,

I hereby announce and effect, on behalf of the Misanthropist's Group,
the creation of three Currencies, with the following characteristics,
as per the provisions of Rule 1722 :

Name: Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1

Name: Payment Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1

Name: Transfer Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1


----Att. 2: Message of 30.07.97 to the public forum (from Kolja A.)

[header snipped to avoid confusing mail readers]

I hereby rename the currencies created by Morendil on behalf of the
Misanthropist's Group in a message of 12.07.97 to the public forum as
follows:

Old name                         New name
---------------------------------------------------------
Orders                           MMM-pounds
Payment Orders                   MMM-shillings
Transfer Orders                  MMM-pence


---
Remark

"Wait, you can't do that! These names are a Nomic Property (NP) of
these currencies and protected by 1011!"

No, they are not. What _is_ an NP is the fact that they do have a
name, i.e. are not nameless. This is explicitly required in 1576, and
not changed by changing the names.

But the particular names were given in a message to the public forum
(unlike the names of rule-defined currencies like VTs, which are given
in the relevant rules). So they are not Nomic Properties, after all,
and not protected by 1011.

Kolja A.
