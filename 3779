And my axe!

Election speech: "CFJ: I am a candidate for Prime Minister."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Jason Cobb's Arguments:

It is undisputed that the nominations for the Prime Minister election had 
not closed at the time that twg (possibly) attempted to become a candidate 
in that election, so that criterion is fulfilled. Next, we must determine 
whether or not twg succeeded in becoming a candidate "by announcement".

Per Rule 478, as interpreted under CFJ 3781, twg can become a candidate by 
"unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e 
performs it." The phrase "and my axe" is not given meaning by the Rules, 
nor any other in-game document that I am aware of. While an unenlightened 
person (such as myself) could probably figure out the general meaning of 
the phrase from some Googling (as I have attempted), I find that the 
phrase "and my axe" is insufficiently clear and unambiguous to be 
EFFECTIVE in performing a by-announcement action.

Twg never became a candidate for the Prime Minister election, so e is not 
a candidate. FALSE. 


Judge Jason Cobb's Evidence:

Rule 478/36:

Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by announcement", 
a person performs that action by unambiguously and clearly specifying the 
action and announcing that e performs it.


Rule 2154/53:

After an election is initiated and until nominations close, any player CAN 
become a candidate by announcement.
