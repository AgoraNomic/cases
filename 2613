Caller's Arguments:

These CFJs are about the Gregorian calendar
(which rule 1023 implies is the one in use, at least for months; maybe
for month naming too). You see, when the calendar in question was
decreed by Pope Gregory XIII, it was slightly different from what is
commonly used nowadays; in particular, the year started on 25 March, and
to introduce an extra day into leap years, leap years had an extra 24
February (as opposed to adding a nonexistent 29 February, as is commonly
done today). The calendar has had that form through much of its history;
for instance, the UK changed to officially starting years on 1 January
in the year 1751/1752 (depending on which year-start date you choose to
measure the changeover date in); so it took that form for about 169
years in the UK, and certainly for the rest of Pope Gregory's lifetime.
A calendar that starts on January 1, or that has its leap year on
February 29, thus cannot be properly considered Gregorian.

Many countries have since changed to the 'modern' calendar, identical to
the Gregorian except in terms of what months and days are called, and
when they start; however, such a change was never made by Agora itself,
and there is no reason it should be beholden to the laws of any given
macronation. Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that 'Gregorian'
references the original Gregorian calendar. In such a case, it is
impossible to perform actions on February 29, because such a date never
exists; and as today is June 25 (July 25?), we've just missed the start
of a month, so the Speaker's too late to publish an Honours List.

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

The fact that the year starts on March 25 has nothing to
do with the starts of months.

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

We may not be tied to the calendar of any particular nation,
but we sure seem to be tied to Unix timestamps.  -G.

Judge Taral's Arguments:

Seriously? The term "Gregorian calendar" is used extensively to denote
the modern calendar. "The Gregorian calendar is the internationally
accepted civil calendar." (Wikipedia) "The calendar currently in
worldwide use for secular purposes..." (Scienceworld)
