========================================================================

Panelist Tiger's Arguments:

I opine REMAND and argue for UNDECIDABLE on the same grounds as appelant
Taral.

========================================================================

Panelist root's Arguments:

I opine OVERRULE with a replacement judgement of UNDECIDABLE.  There
seems to be general consensus that this is correct, and there are not
really any open issues that need to be explored here.
