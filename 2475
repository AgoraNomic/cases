Gratuitous Arguments by ais523:

Calling it on the statement "Winning the game by announcement is a
rule-defined action" might be more interesting.

Anyway, I submit rule 2223 as gratuitous arguments on that CFJ, because
it certainly gives a situation in which the game can be won by
announcement. I also submit the People's Bank of Agora as a gratuitous
argument on that CFJ, even though it wasn't expecting it and it's rather
out of place.

Rule 2223/1 (Power=2)
Win by Junta

      Upon a win announcement that a rule states that one or more
      persons CAN cause it to make arbitrary rule changes by
      announcement, all those persons satisfy the Winning Condition of
      Dictatorship.

      Cleanup procedure:  Those persons SHALL as soon as possible
      amend the rule so that it no longer states this, and SHOULD
      amend the rules to prevent this condition from being achieved
      again in essentially the same way.

That wouldn't make sense.  "By announcement" would be a possible
mechanism for performing the action, not an attribute of the action
itself.  Consider R478:

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
      and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs
      it.

Gratuitous counter-arguments:  Rule 2223 defines an announcement that
causes the game to be won, not a "win the game" action that is
performed by announcement.

Judge Wooble's Arguments:

The first paragraph of R2186 reads:
      Winning Conditions and Losing Conditions are conditions defined
      as such by the rules.  When one or more persons satisfy at least
      one Winning Condition and do not satisfy any Losing Conditions,
      all such persons win the game.  The game CANNOT be won in any
      other way, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

This defines 'to win the game', so the question is whether this
winning can be said to be an "action", as it's something that takes
place Platonically rather than being something the player as an agent
takes an active role in. Clearly it's a verb so as some level it's an
action,  but is it an action as the term is used by the rules?

R2152's usage may be instructive here:
      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID:  Attempts to
         perform the described action are unsuccessful.

R2186 uses "CANNOT"; we can infer that it must be describing an action
to have meaning.  I judge TRUE.
