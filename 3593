Pretty self-explanatory. I think it does include puns, but that doesn't
mean it IS a pun.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Political Parties", reading as
follows:

      There are 5 Parties, in order:
      
      - Platonic Isolationists
      - New Punchbowl Reformers
      - Costume Conservatives
      - Substance Use Liberals
      - Official Raving Monster Looney Party

      Politicians are entities; each Politician has a name and an
      associated Party. Politicians exist only as specified by the
      rules. Creating, altering, or destroying Politicians is secured.

      If there are ever fewer than 20 Politicians, then the Clork CAN
      and SHALL, by announcement, create a new Politician, specifying
      eir Party and name. The Party must be selected at random from:
     
      - If any Party has fewer than 3 Politicans, the Party or Parties
        with the fewest.
      - Otherwise, the Parties with fewer than 5 Politicians.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Clork", reading as follows:

      The Clork (pronounced "clark") is an office. The Clork's weekly
      report includes:
      - a list of all Politicans with their names and Parties.
      - the assignment of Policies to Parties.
      
      The portion of a document purporting to be a Clork's report
      containing the above information is self-ratifying.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Echelon Forms", reading as follows:

      A Post is a position which can be held by at most one Politician.
      Each Politican can hold at most one Post at a time. Each Post is
      in an Echelon, which has an associated Rank. The Echelons, and
      their Posts and Ranks, are as follows:

      Chamber of Power (Rank 5):
      - Host
      Upper Echelon (Rank 3):
      - Planner
      - Enforcer
      - Organizer
      - Creep
      Row Echelon (Rank 1):
      - Schmoozer
      - Decorator
      - Loner
      - Drunk
      - Mystery
      - Wild One
      - Hat Rack

      Each Politician who holds a Post is in the Echelon of that post;
      other Politicians are in the Row-Reduced Echelon, which has Rank
      0. Likewise, the Rank of a Post or Politician is the Rank of their
      Echelon.

      If a rule provides that a Post can take an action, then the
      Advisor of the holder of that Post CAN take that action. If there
      is no such player, and the Post is required to take that action,
      then the Clork CAN do it prior to any deadline for its
      performance. After a deadline for a Post to perform an action, any
      player CAN take it.
Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Taken Under Advisement", reading as
follows:

      Advisor is a Politician switch, tracked by the Clork, with
      possible values all players and none (default). For each
      Politician, Influence over <Politician> is a natural player
      switch, tracked by the Clork.

      A player CAN, by announcement, spend Favours in a Party to gain
      Influence over that Politican, depending on the Politician's
      Echelon:
      - Chamber of Power: 3 Favours for 2 Influence
      - Upper Echelon: 1 Favour for 1 Influence
      - Row Echelon: 2 Favours for 3 Influence
      - Row-Reduced Echelon: 1 Favour for 2 Influence

      If a player has more Influence over a given Politician than any
      other player, e can Advise that Politican by announcement. When e
      does so, if no other player Advises the same Politician later in
      the same Agoran week, then at the start of the next Agoran week,
      that player becomes that Politician's Advisor.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Balloons", reading as follows:

      Balloons are a fixed currency, tracked by the Clork, with
      ownership restricted to players. Creation or destruction of
      balloons is secured.
      
      At the start of each Agoran week, after Advisors are flipped:
      - For each player, if e owns more Balloons than e was awarded by
        this procedure at the start of the previous week, any excess
        Balloons are destroyed.
      - Each player is awarded Balloons equal to the sum of the Ranks of
        the Politicians for which e is Advisor.
      - The Decorator's Advisor, if any is awarded one additional
        Balloon.

      A player CAN, by announcement, spend a Balloon e owns to increase
      eir voting strength on a specified Agoran Decision, other than one
      with an adoption index of 3 or higher, by 1.

      A player CAN, by announcement, spend Balloons equal to the sum of
      the Ranks of all Posts in order to win the game. Upon doing so,
      all eir Influence switches are set to 0.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Party Favours", reading as follows:

      For each Party, there is a currency called Favours in that Party.
      Ownership of Favours is tracked by the Clork. Ownership of Favours
      is restricted to players.

      A player CAN, by announcement, spend 3 Favours in a single Party
      to award another player 2 Favours in that Party.

      A player CAN, by announcement, spend 3 Favours in a single Party
      to gain a Favour in another specified Party.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Retirement", reading as follows:

      Stress Level is a natural Politician switch, tracked by the Clork.
      At the start of each Agoran week, each Politician's Stress Level
      is increased by eir Rank. If, after this procedure, a Politician's
      Stress Level is 20 or greater, the Politician announces retirement
      and is destroyed at the beginning of the following Agoran week.
      The Clork SHALL announce this fact in a timely fashion.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Political Elections", reading as
follows:

      For each Post, Vote for <Post> is a secured Politician switch
      tracked by the Clork, with possible values all Politicians and
      undecided (default).

      The voting strength of a Politician for a Post is defined as
      follows:
      - For an election for Host, Politicians have strength equal to
        their Rank.
      - For an election for an Upper Echelon Post, the Host has strength
        4, and Upper Echelon Politicians have strength 2.
      - For an election for a Row Echelon Post, the Host has strength 3,
        Upper Echelon Politicians have strength 2, and Row Echelon
        politicians have strength 1.
      - The Organizer has voting strength 1 greater than e would have
        based on the above.

      The eligible Politicians in an election for a Post are all
      Politicians in the highest non-empty Echelon below that of the
      Post up for election. The number of votes cast for an eligible
      Politician in an election is the sum of voting strengths for that
      Post of all Politician voting for em; the number of votes cast for
      an ineligible Politician is 0.

      An election for a Post is resolvable if that Post is vacant, there
      is a single Politician with the most votes in that election, and
      either at least four days have passed since either the vacancy or
      since its previous occupant Announced Retirement, whichever was
      first, or if the leader has more votes than the Policitian with
      the second-most, plus the total voting strength of all undecided
      Politicians in that election. When an election for a Post is
      resolvable, any player CAN, by announcement, end the election and
      install the winning Politician (which must be specified or else
      the announcement is INEFFECTIVE) into the Post.

      If a Post is vacant and either has been so for seven days or more
      than eleven days have passed since its previous holder Announced
      Retirement, then the Host CAN and SHALL, in a timely fashion, by
      announcement end the election and install one of the Politicians
      with the most votes into the Post.

      When an election for a Post ends, all Vote switches for that Post
      are set to undecided.

Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Party Policy", reading as follows:

      There are 5 Policies, in order:

      - Justice: interested in seeing justice served
      - Efficiency: interested in seeing official duties performed
      - Legislation: interested in seeing proposals passed
      - Participation: interested in seeing votes cast
      - Economy: interested in economic activity

      At any time, each Policy is held by exactly one Party. The
      assignments must be in cyclic order of their definitions, wrapping
      from bottom to top. For example, if the Platonic Isolationists
      hold Participation as their Policy, then the New Punchbowl Reformers
      hold Economy, the Costume Conservatives hold Justice, and so on.

      At the start of each Agoran month, the Planner CAN and SHALL, in a
      timely fashion, by announcement, select a new assignment of
      Policies to Parties (specifying the Policy of one Party is
      sufficient, since it implies the remainder). E CANNOT specify
      either of the assignments used in the previous two months.

Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Favour Awards":

      The following officers CAN by announcement award Favours in the
      listed Parties, but SHALL NOT do so except as required by rule.

      - Arbitor and Referee: the Party holding Justice.
      - ADoP: the Party holding Efficiency.
      - Assessor: the Parties holding Legislation and Participation.
      - Clork: all Parties.

      When a player judges a CFJ, the Arbitor SHALL, in a timely
      fashion, award that player 3 Favours in the Party holding Justice.
      When a player's Finger-Pointing leads to a Card award, or when the
      Referee issues Summary Judgement, the Referee shall award a Favour
      in the Party holding Justice to the responsible player.

      Complexity is an office switch, tracked by the ADoP, with values 1
      (default), 2, and 3. The ADoP CAN, without 2 Objections, set the
      Complexity of an office. As part of eir weekly duties, the ADoP
      SHALL award to each officeholder a number of Favours in the Party
      holding Efficiency equal to the Complexity of that Office.

      Whenever the Assessor resolves an Agoran decision:
      - If the decision was to adopt a proposal, and it was ADOPTED, e
        SHALL immediately award the proposal's author a number of
        Favours in the Party holding Legislation equal to the proposal's
        AI, rounded up.
      - For each voter who has not voted on an Agoran decision resolved
        earlier in the same Agoran week, e SHALL award that player 2
        Favours in the Party holding Participaiton.

      Any player CAN spend shinies equal to the Favour Value to gain a
      Favour in the Party holding Economy.

      As part of eir weekly duties, the Clork SHALL award, to the
      Advisor of a Politician holding one of the below offices, 3
      Favours in the corresponding Party:
      - Loner: Platonic Isolationists
      - Drunk: New Punchbowl Reformers
      - Mystery: Costume Conservatives
      - Wild One: Substance Use Liberals
      - Hat Rack: Official Raving Monster Looney Party

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Post Powers":

      The Creep CAN by announcement, but no more than once per Agoran
      week, increase eir own Stress Level by 1 in order to increase the
      Stress Level of another specified Politician by 2.

      The Schmoozer CAN by announcement, but no more than once per
      Agoran week, change the Party of a specified other Politician to
      the next Party in order, wrapping around.

      The Enforcer CAN, no more than once per week, with Support from at
      least one other Politician not in the Row-Reduced Echelon, remove
      a specified Row Echelon Politician from eir Post. E must specify
      the supporting Politician when doing so, or it is INEFFECTIVE.
      Upon doing so, both the Enforcer and supporting Politician's
      Stress Levels are increased by 1.

Set the Complexities of the offices as follows:
- ADoP: 2
- Agronomist: 1
- Arbitor: 2
- Assessor: 3
- Clork: 2
- Fearmongor: 1
- Herald: 1
- Notary: 2
- Prime Minister: 1
- Promotor: 2
- Referee: 2
- Registrar: 2
- Regkeepor: 1
- Reportor: 1
- Rulekeepor: 3
- Speaker: 1
- Surveyor: 1
- Tailor: 1
- Treasuror: 3

Amend rule 2497, Floating Value, by appending "- Favour Value: 1/10th of
the Floating Value, rounded up." to the list of Derived Floating Values.

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Get This Party Started", reading as
follows:
      The Clork CAN, by announcement, and SHALL, in a timely fashion
      after this rule is enacted:
      - Create 20 Politicians, 4 in each Party, specifying their names;
      - Increase each Politician's Stress Level by twice eir Rank;
      - Assign one Politician to each Post, chosen at random;
      - Randomly assign Policies to Parties (obeying the cyclic order
        restriction); then
      - Cause this rule to repeal itself.

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, while this rule is in
      effect, it provides the only mechanism by which Politicians can be
      created, Posts or Policies assigned, Stress Levels changed.
      Moreover, rules to the contrary notwithstanding, Favour cannot be
      created.

Judge ATMunn's Arguments:

Rule 1650 states:
        "A Silly Proposal is a Proposal whose sole contents are one of the
        following:
        i) A limerick.
        ii) A rhymed poem no longer than fourteen lines. (No free verse!)
        iii) A joke of no more than a hundred words.
        iv) A truly hideous pun."

The uncertainty arises from what counts as a "truly hideous pun" and the
phrase "sole contents." The caller's arguments are as follows:

"Pretty self-explanatory. I think it does include puns, but that
doesn't mean it IS a pun."

Although it is true, the proposal does include several puns, if you look
at it more closely, the whole proposal follows one main pun, that being,
political parties being taken as actual parties. It seems to me that
this overarching pun in the proposal does count as the entire proposal
being a pun. Also, it seems nearly impossible, under the caller's
arguments, that any proposal could be a Silly Proposal by being a pun,
as a pun is usually thought of as being just the main joke, not the
entire text it is part of. It would be extremely difficult to create a
proposal this small. Therefore, I judge CFJ 3593 TRUE.
