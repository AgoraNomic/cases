==============================  CFJ 1738  ==============================

    rule 2149's obligation on a knave to not publish statements that e
    believes are true is in conflict with the knave's right of
    participation in the fora.

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 101(vi) provides that

      Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

This is reinforced by rule 478's provision that

      No Player shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora.

Rule 2149, after defining "knave" as a subtype of player, says that

      A knave SHALL NOT publish statements that e believes are true or
      which e is reckless regarding the veracity of.

R101 and R478 are not explicit on what constitutes "participation" in
the fora.  Applying common sense, the general purpose of a forum is for
people to send information and ideas to each other, which is naturally
done by sending messages that the author believes are true.  The public
forum, specifically, has the major purpose of sending information, and
is also the place for many game actions which are taken by means of a
statement saying that the action is being taken.

R2149's prohibition obviously impacts the ordinary way to disseminate
information in a forum.  It will no doubt be argued by some that a
knave could disseminate information by means of false statements, if it
is understood that e habitually does so, but this would be a confusing
arrangement and seems an unreasonable imposition on a player.  It's also
incompatible with the various situations where the rules require a player
to publish certain information.  I also note in passing that if a player
were classed as a FOOL, being both knight and knave, e would be denied
this possible escape.

The situation for game actions that are taken by announcement is worse.
Rules that provide for action by announcement generally will trigger on
statements such as "I hereby vote FOR proposal 5678.".  If the attempt
at action is successful then the statement is true, and if the actor
believed that the action would be successful then e believed that the
statement would be true.  There is no provision whereby a person can
take such actions by means of a false statement.  A statement such as "I
do not hereby vote FOR proposal 5678." would not succeed in performing
an action, because it does not claim to perform an action, and would
be a true statement of fact.  Prohibiting a player from posting true
statements thus denies em the right to take many game actions, which is
a major aspect of participation in the public forum.

R2149 thus generally prohibits a knave from participating in the public
forum in any reasonable manner, and specifically prohibits em from those
actions that are the main purpose of the public forum.  This is clearly
at odds with eir R101 right.

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

The last paragraph of 2149:
      Merely quoting a statement does not constitute publishing it for
      the purposes of this rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause,
      or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes part of
      the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or
      falsity of the whole is what is significant.
actually makes it relatively easy (unfortunately) for a knave to
perform game actions anyway, or otherwise publish true statements.
For example, a TTttPF is generally accepted as performing actions even
though the main body of the message is a quote, and therefore
irrelevant to Rule 2149.

Judge root's Arguments:

I concur with the Initiator's arguments and enter a judgement of TRUE.
