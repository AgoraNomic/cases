========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 2429 states "Whitespace is generally insignificant, except for
paragraph breaks."

Every definition of "whitespace" I checked (list at the end) includes
or does not reasonably bar the "space" character from being
whitespace.

Thus, Rule 2429 by its own logic also says
"Whitespaceisgenerallyinsignificant,exceptforparagraphbreaks."
Arguably this string is meaningless, though it's reasonably possible
to decipher the original format of the sentence.

However, Rule 2429 also says "Whites pace is generally in significant,
except for paragraph break s." Since this is not only nonesense but
also nonesense that refers to an unindentified "break s," this is
clearly a different meaning that the meaning implied by the version
currently on the SLR.

The second and third renderings of 2429 have a different meaning than
the first and say nothing about whether or not whitespace is
significant. If whitespace is not significant, then rule 2429 (and
most other rules) have extremely ambiguous meanings, many of which do
not say that whitespace is significant. Therefore if Rule 2429 is
true, it both does and does not say that whitespace is insignificant,
in the exact same sentence and the exact same clause of that sentence.

Judge ais523's Arguments:

There are two sensible readings of rule 2429. One is as the presumably
intended "It is insignificant what choices in whitespace are made when
representing rules as text"; with this interpretation, nothing is
broken. However, it somewhat contradicts rule 2141, which implies that a
rule content is text itself, rather than being a sequence of words that
is merely represented as text.

The other reading is "In general, it is possible to add or remove
whitespace (other than paragraph breaks) from a rule without changing
its meaning". As written, this is simply a false statement, and as the
caller points out, it cannot sensibly be interpreted as a legal fiction.
The situation is similar to that of a hypothetical rule which states
"This rule can be interpreted with an interpretation other than the
obvious one". I don't see a paradox or contradiction there, just a lie.

I judge CFJ 3430 FALSE.
