Gratuitous Arguments by Taral:

Ooo, good point. Fair enough.

========================================================================

Panelist G.'s Arguments:

I move to REMAND 2355a.  It should be overturned based on the Defendant's
arguments (to which the Judge agrees) but it's unfair to punish the
judge when the Defendant did not provide eir argument in a timely
manner.  -Goethe

========================================================================

Panelist Murphy's Arguments:

I move to REMAND each of these.  I'm not sure whether the judge
intended to agree with the defendant's late arguments or merely
acknowledge that they have some weight, but in any case I believe
e will give them due consideration in a re-judgement.
