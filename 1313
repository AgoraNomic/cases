Caller's Arguments:

First of all, note that the above general statement (if found true,
suitable for Rules annotation) is addressed to a specific case by the
following implied Statement, which would be TRUE if the above is TRUE:
"Wes has lost Power of Attorney over the Zombie Anthony".  Wes's case is
used as an example as it aids the argument.  (But if for some reason Wes
is not a Zombie at the time of this CFJ, the general case should still
hold).

Wes is a Zombie Master by the definition of Rule 1884, because e owns the
Property that is the Zombie Anthony.  However, being a Zombie Master
(owning a Zombie) doesn't necessarily mean holding PoA over that Zombie,
as reflected by the second clause of Rule 1884: "Whenever the Master of a
Zombie is a Player, e has Power of Attorney for that Zombie, unless the
Rules withdraw it from em."

Wes emself became a Zombie on or near August 3 2001, triggering, among
other things, Rule 1755.  Rule 1755 states in part: "When a player becomes
deregistered or a Zombie, e ceases to be a candidate, officer, judge, or
in general to occupy any role or position to which a Rule assigns any
duties or powers. No one who is not registered, or who is a Zombie, may
occupy such a role or position.  This rule takes precedence over rules
which would prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position."

Note that even without this final clause, Rule 1755 has numerical
precedence over 1884.

Power of Attorney is clearly one position of power referred to by the
words "a position to which a Rule assigns both duties and powers":  If the
use of the word 'Power' in the phrase 'Power of Attorney' isn't sufficient
to permit this interpretation, the judge is respectfully referred to Rules
1842 and 1989 that together give assigns PoA holders the specific Agoran
duties and powers of a Prime Executor.

I argue that it is unreasonable to interpret this differently; otherwise,
a deregistered Player could keep PoA over a Zombie, and thus be an Agoran
Entity's Rules-defined executor without emself being bound by the Rules
of Agora in any way.

Note that this Statement, if judged TRUE, merely implies (for this
specific example) that Wes's PoA over Anthony ceased when Wes became
a Zombie.  This CFJ Statement takes no position on:
 (1) whether paying Upkeep is a duty, or whether Wes or eir executor
     is required to transfer possession of the Property Anthony to any
     other entity;
 (2) whether Wes would regain PoA if e ceased to be a Zombie while
     continuing to hold Anthony as Property;
 (3) whether the most general case is true, that no zombie may hold any
     PoA over any entity.  (This last is strongly implied, but there may
     be other aspects of non-Zombie PoAs of which I am unaware).

These are all questions worthy of investigation, but for another day.

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1884/4 (Power=1)
Zombie Masters

      Zombies are Property.  The owner of a Zombie is called eir
      Master.  Whenever a Player becomes a Zombie, eir Master is the
      Bank.

      Whenever the Master of a Zombie is a Player, e has Power of
      Attorney for that Zombie, unless the Rules withdraw it from
      em.

      The Registrar is the Recordkeepor of each Zombie.


Rule 1755/5 (Power=1)
No Non-Player Responsibilities

      When a player becomes deregistered or a Zombie, e ceases to be
      a candidate, officer, judge, or in general to occupy any role or
      position to which a Rule assigns any duties or powers.  No one
      who is not registered, or who is a Zombie, may occupy such a
      role or position.  This rule takes precedence over rules which
      would prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position.

      The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the Bearing of Patent
      Titles, or any position which a Rule specifically says may be
      held by a non-Player or Zombie, nor shall it act to prevent a
      non-Player or Zombie from registering, calling CFJs, or doing
      things that non-Players and Zombies are generally able to do.

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

The Caller's arguments appear to be correct in all aspects.
