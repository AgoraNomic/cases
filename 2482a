Panelist G.'s Arguments:

First, I note that the judgement here doesn't answer the scam at all but
rather answers a more arcane technical point; ais523 called a second CFJ
with a better phrasing, so there is no conflict of interest.  From a
practical view, since the second CFJ exists, better to close this one on
a technical point than ask it to be re-examined while a second judge looks
at the second case.

As reasoning for affirm, the following discussion thread:

Panelist Pavitra's Arguments:

I opine AFFIRM with the below-quoted arguments. I intend, with the
Support of the rest of the panel, to cause the panel to judge AFFIRM and
publish the below-quoted arguments as a concurring opinion with an error
rating of 25.

========================================================================

Panelist Wooble's Arguments:

I opine REASSIGN.  Precedence is only defined where there is a
conflict and the judge did not examine whether there is such a
conflict.  Affirming the ruling of TRUE would set a precedent that a
conflict exists, which directly implies that forbidding excess NoVs to
be filed by announcement is a violation of a player's R101 rights.

Panelist scshunt's Arguments:

I opine REASSIGN for the reasons outlined by Wooble.
