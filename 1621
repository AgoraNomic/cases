========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

On February 7, 2007, GreyKnight announced "I deem myself to be
deregistered".  If this is interpreted as synonymous with "I
deregister", then by Rule 869 e deregistered, and the statement
is false.  Otherwise, e did not deregister, the statement is true,
and Rule 217 requires the judge to base eir judgement on this
truth; no rule requires em to base it on GreyKnight's truthiness.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Evidence:

1.  GreyKnight's message:
From: Grey Knight <greyknight3@yahoo.com>
To: agora-business@agoranomic.org
Date: Wed, 7 Feb 2007 02:50:48 -0800 (PST)

I deem myself to be deregistered.




God bless,
The Grey Knight

3.  R478/16, last paragraph:

      A player performs an action "by announcement" by announcing that
      e performs it.  A player performs an action "by private message"
      to some player by sending an appropriate private message to the
      specified player.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.

4.  R869/17:

How to Join and Leave Agora

      A person who is not currently registered as a player and is not
      prohibited from registering is permitted to register.

      A person registers or deregisters by announcement.

      Whenever a person registers, e becomes a player.

      Whenever a player deregisters or is deregistered, e ceases to be
      a player and is prohibited from registering for the next thirty
      days.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

The definition of "deem" is to have an opinion.

The relevant rule is that an action is performed by announcement.  An
expression of opinion is not the same as taking action.  Therefore, GreyKnight
expressing eir opinion that e was deregistered was NOT the same as em
deregistering.

========================================================================

Appellant G.'s Arguments:

OscarMeyr's arguments in
http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/2007-April/00
6235.html
argue FALSE to the statement "GreyKnight has successfully deregistered" and
therefore should be TRUE for the actual CFJ statement of "GreyKnight is a
player."

TRUE.

I also call for appeal of CFJ 1621, on the same grounds.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

My reasoning was correct, but I got the conclusion reversed.

I determined that GreyKnight's deeming emself to be deregistered was not a
deregistration.  But the original statement was if GreyKnight was a player,
not if e had deregistered.  The ruling on the original statement is therefore
TRUE.
