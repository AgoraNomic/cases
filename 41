[Comment from the Clerk:  DNicol here provides a compelling argument
 for the re-creation of the Nomic Doofus, as well as supporting the
 case for punitive action against stupid CFJs.  I refer the Judge to
 the *Initial Rule* 205, in anticipation of a speedy Judgement of
 FALSE.]

{ David Wagner defaulted on 1/10/93, and was replaced by Jeffrey S.
Davidson on the same day. }

{ 1/10/93: Jeffrey Davidson accepts }
