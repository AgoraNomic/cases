Judge's Arguments

The relevant excerpt from rule 869:
{{{
      A person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or prevented by the
      rules) register by publishing a message that indicates
      reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e intends
      to become a player at that time.
}}}

The original message had a subject line of "BUS: Registration", and
nothing in the message body contradicts the initial impression (that
most players would get upon seeing a message with that subject from a
nonplayer) that the message was indeed an attempt to register. Gaelan
has been a player before, and is likely aware of Agoran customs related
to registration; I think it's reasonably clear that Gaelan expected to
become a player as a result of the message, which in turn implies that
e intended to become a player (otherwise e would not have sent it).
The other possible interpretations would involve the message being a
discussion of, or otherwise comment on, registration, but those don't
seem to be compatible with its content.

It's worth noting that registration intentionally has a lower standard
for ambiguity/clarity than most other actions; an action such as
registering with a suggestive subject line works when restricted to
registration, but would likely fail for any of our wide range of by-
announcement actions.

I judge CFJ 3501 TRUE.
