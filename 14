JUDGEMENT 13 (David Cogen) Tue, 17 Aug 93, 14:05:23 Pacific Time

STATEMENT:
I was inappropriately penalized for referring to the Circumcised Speaker as the
"Circumsized Speaker", as this is merely another denotation for the same word.

JUDGE:
The Judge for this Statement shall be Sai <sai@comp.vuw.ac.nz>, according
to Rule 364. As per Rules 215 and 364, Sai has three days in which to decline
the appointment or one week in which to return a Judgement of TRUE, FALSE, or
UNDECIDED, or he shall lose 10 points.

Enjoy!
