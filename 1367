Judge root's Arguments:

In the message referred to, Craig attempted to give eir Vote "Sir Toby"
for Speaker-Elect Pamphlet the nickname "Pam", and then e attempted to
transfer Pam to the proposal titled "The Importance of Being Craig",
which e had submitted five minutes prior.

Goethe's judgement in CFJ 1361 suggests that the nicknaming attempt
succeeded, at least in the context of that message.  I find that Craig
clearly indicated which properties were to be transferred, that e owned
the properties to be transferred, that e clearly named a Rules-defined
entity as the recipient, and that the message was sent over a public
forum, ensuring receipt by the currency's recordkeepor, so all
requirements set down by Rule 1598 were met.  I therefore find the
statement to be TRUE.

========================================================================

Judge root's Evidence:

Rule 1598/12 (Power=1)
Property Transfers

      (a) A Notice of Transfer is a message which sets forth the
          intent to transfer one or more Properties from one entity
          (the "transferor") to some other entity (the "transferee").

      (b) A valid Notice of Transfer must additionally:
          (1) specify one or more Properties all of which are owned by
              the transferor; and
          (2) be sent by the Executor of the transferor, or by a
              Limited Executor of the transferor with the authority to
              execute transfers on behalf of that entity with respect
              to all of the Properties involved.

      (c) A transfer of a Property occurs only when its Recordkeepor
          receives a valid Notice of Transfer.

      (d) The effect of a transfer of Properties is to cause the
          transferor to cease to possess the Properties transferred,
          and simultaneously to cause the transferee to possess them.

      (e) The Recordkeepor of a Property shall maintain a record of
          all transfers of that Property. E shall retain a record of
          each Notice of Transfer which e receives (whether valid or
          not) involving that Property. E shall retain this record of
          each Notice of Transfer for at least four weeks after its
          receipt.

      (f) If the transferor transfers Property to the transferee with
          the purpose of satisfying a debt, or of paying the Fee
          associated with performing an action, but the debt does not
          exist, or the action is not successfully performed, then the
          transferor may publicly demand the return of the Property.
          The effect of such a demand is to cause the transferee to
          incur a debt to the transferor for the Property transferred.

I propose the following proposal. I transfer 0 papyri to the bank to
rubberstamp it. The proposal is to be titled "The Importance of Being
Craig".

-----Begin Proposal-----
ADD A RULE, TITLED "NULL RULE", WHICH READS, "".
THEN, REPEAL THE RULE TITLED "NULL RULE".
FAIL TO ADD A RULE, TITLED "THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING CRAIG", WHICH READS,
"BEING NAMED CRAIG IS A WIN CONDITION."
------End Proposal------

I give the nickname "Pam" to the Vote "Sir Toby" for Speaker Elect Pamphlet
in my posession.
I transfer Pam to my own undistributed insane proposal known as "The
Importance of Being Craig".
