"The words `other Rules' in the sentence:
   `This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
    sentence.' in Rule 1504,
 should be interpreted as meaning `Rules other than this one'."

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

I Judge this statement to be FALSE.  The fuller context of the
sentence is, of course:

   This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would require another
   Player to report Score, Currency, or Blot changes which result from
   these penalties, or which would require a different timing for such
   penalties.

   This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
   sentence.

The antecedant of "other" here is clearly the "any Rule" in the
previous sentence.  That is, the end of this Rule is of the form:

  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that X.

  This Rule defers to all other Rules that Y.

The obvious interpretation, at least to this native speaker, is that
the Rule defers to all and only those Rules which Y, but do not X.
There is a mild ambiguity here, in that "all other Rules" *could* be
read to mean "all Rules besides this one", but that seems unnatural to
me.  In no reasonable context that I can construct does the word word
"other" in statements of the form

  This Rule does X to all A's that N.

  This Rule does not-X to all other A's that M.

seem to mean "other besides this very one" rather than "other besides
the ones we just mentioned".

It has been argued that the sentence

   This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
   sentence.

appears in various other places in the Rules, and in those other
places the phrase "other Rules" does in fact mean "other Rules than
this one".  I would counter that:

  - In most of those cases, the context is critically different, in
    that there is no other antecedant available available for the
    "other", and we are therefore left only with "this very Rule".
    When the antecedant *is* available, it is natural to accept it,
    and not look elsewhere.

  - In at least two other places in the Ruleset (perhaps only one at
    the time this CFJ was called) the same context *does* occur (see
    R1367/1).  But the meaning of the last sentence in this case has
    never been tested, as far as I know, either by CFJ or by routine
    Game operation.  So Game Custom is silent as to the interpretation
    of this sentence in this context.  If there were complete
    ambiguity here, in that there were just no other way to decide
    which of the possible readings of "other Rules" was the correct
    one, we might get a wisp of weight out of this.  My feeling,
    though, is that the ambiguity is not nearly this delicately
    balanced, and the wisp here is not strong enough to counteract the
    easy availability of the antecedant.

Since "other Rules" in R1504 actually means "other Rules than the ones
we just mentioned", and not "Rules other than this one", I must Judge
this Statement FALSE.

(Caller's) Arguments:

The last two paragraphs of the Rule read:

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would require
      another Player to report Score, Currency, or Blot changes which
      result from these penalties, or which would require a different
      timing for such penalties.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

This final sentence was only recently added by the Virus, and is the
source of the confusion. The words "other Rules" are ambiguous. They
could potentially mean either "Rules other than this one" or "Rules
other than those just described (in the previous paragraph)".

I put it to you that either interpretation is valid, but that game
custom favours the first interpretation, as evidenced by all the other
infected rules.

I urge the Judge to issue an Injunction to annotate this Rule appropriately,
as per Rule 789.

Evidence:
---------

Rule 1504/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Application and Timing of Crimes and Infractions

      Penalties for a Crime are applied 72 hours after the CotC
      legally reports the penalty.  If the CFJ alleging the Crime is
      appealed before this time, then application of the penalty is
      deferred until immediately after the resolution of the appeal.

      If an appeal finds that the Crime has occurred and the penalty
      has not yet been applied, then the penalty is applied
      immediately upon resolution of the appeal.

      If an appeal finds the Crime did not occur, the penalty shall
      not be applied.  If the penalty has already been applied, then
      the penalty shall be reversed to the extent possible immediately
      upon resolution of the appeal.

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report.  The Player so penalized is permitted to submit a
      CFJ alleging that the Infraction did not occur.  If this CFJ is
      found TRUE, then the penalties are reversed, to the extent
      possible, 72 hours from the time of Judgement.  If the CFJ is
      appealed before this time, this reversal is deferred until
      immediately after the appeal is resolved.

      If an appeal finds that the Infraction did not occur, and the
      penalty has not been reversed, the penalty is reversed to the
      extent possible immediately upon resolution of the appeal.

      If an appeal finds that the Infraction did occur, then the
      penalty shall not be reversed.  If the penalty has been
      reversed, the penalty is immediately re-applied upon resolution
      of the appeal.

      Detecting and reporting the consequences of penalty reversals
      and re-applications due to this Rule shall be the duty of the
      Clerk of the Courts.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would require
      another Player to report Score, Currency, or Blot changes which
      result from these penalties, or which would require a different
      timing for such penalties.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.
