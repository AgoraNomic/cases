JUDGEMENT 23 (Wes) Wed, 1 Sep 93

STATEMENT

Proposal 305 stated that it Amended Rule 202. This means that the text
contained within Proposal 305 replaces the text which was contained in Rule
202 to make Rule 305.

JUDGEMENT
I find this statement to be TRUE.
 
[Comment: Whereas this is what 'Amend 202' means in this case, the
meaning could depend on context. E.g. a phrase 'Amend 202 by inserting
...' would still amend 202, but in this case a statement of the kind
above would have to be judged FALSE. I do not, however, think this was
what Wes intended to question in his CFJ.]
