Caller's Evidence:

(message sent 09 Feb 2019 13:30:06 +0000)

I modify the contract formed on Monday to which G. and I are parties by
changing its text to read as follows:

{
This is a contract. Any person can become a party to this contract. twg
and G. CAN, by announcement, cease to be parties to this contract; other
parties CANNOT cease to be parties.

twg CAN modify this contract by announcement, with the exception that
twg CANNOT (and SHALL NOT attempt to) modify this contract such that it
imposes any obligation on G. or otherwise significantly harms eir
standing in the game, or such that this paragraph is removed, altered or
otherwise rendered ineffective.

Herrings are a currency defined by this contract. Ownership of herrings
is restricted to any entity. twg CAN, by announcement, create a herring
in the possession of any entity.

Each herring has a colour, which is red. The colour of a herring is set
when it is created and cannot thereafter be changed. An attempt to
create a herring is INEFFECTIVE if the colour of the herring is not
specified.

twg is allowed to act on behalf of any other party to this contract,
except G.
}

I then, as permitted by Rule 1742/20, modify the contract by changing
the set of parties to it to the set of all players.



If I were malevolently inclined, I would now submit the following
proposal, make Aris distribute it, initiate a Rank 8 Festival with
support from Aris, D. Margaux, Murphy and nichdel, get each of their
ballots cast FOR it, and then make them deregister (preventing them from
withdrawing their ballots).

Title: Seems Derivative
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: twg
Co-authors:


Re-enact Rule 2469, "Dictatorship", with Power 3.0 and the following
text:

  A Decree is a document clearly labeled as such. The Dictator CAN,
  With Notice, proclaim a Decree. When a Decree is proclaimed, then:
    1) its power is set to 3,
    2) it takes effect by applying, to the greatest extent permitted
       by the rules, the changes specified in its text to the game
       state, and then,
    3) its power is set to 0.

Re-enact Rule 2470, "The Dictator", with Power 3.0 and the following
text:

  twg is the Dictator.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

(For clarity, the above proposal is published only for illustration; I
DO NOT submit it at this time.)

There are probably other ways to get the proposal passed given the
ability to act on anyone's behalf, but this was the least destructive
foolproof way that I could think of. (I considered a Ratification
Without Objection, but (a) it's possible there is some blanket effect
somewhere that prevents rules being modified by ratification - I
wouldn't have wanted to risk it, and (b) G. would still have been able
to object to it.)



Instead...



I act on behalf of Telnaior to retract eir objection to my intent to
Declare Apathy;

and I Declare Apathy, specifying the following set of players: {twg}.



I publish the following thesis:

blep.

--- end of thesis ---

I act on behalf of Telnaior to retract eir objection to my intent to
award myself the degree Associate of Nomic.

I act on behalf of ATMunn to support my intent to award myself the

Thank you, everybody, for your unanimous approval of my thesis. I
couldn't have done it without you. I shall repay you by not stealing all
your money.
