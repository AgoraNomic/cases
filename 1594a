Panelist OscarMeyr's Arguments:

I find no fault in the Trial Judge's arguments, and I see no counter arguments
by any appellant, nor any issues in the Rules.  I move to SUSTAIN.

========================================================================

Panelist Cecilius's Arguments:

Judge Sherlock in eir decision makes much of the repeal of the Rules defining
the position of Registrar, however, in doing so e appears to have missed the
provisions of Rule 1789 itself.

The steps listed in that rule are:

1. A Player feels e has been treated so egregiously by the Agoran community
that e can no longer abide to be part of it.

2. E submits a document to the Clerk of the Courts, clearly labeled a Cantus
Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir reproach for those who e
feels have treated em so badly.

3. As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk of the
Courts publishes the Cantus Cygneus along with a Writ of Fugere Agorae
Grandissima Exprobatione (which commands the Player to be deregistered and
instructs the Registrar to note the method of deregistration for that Player
in subsequent Registrar Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.)

4. "The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ"

5. The notation in the Registrar's Report ensures that all may know the Player
deregistered in a Writ of FAGE.

In referring to the instruction portion of the Writ, Judge Sherlock stated
that "Since the Registrar is no longer a defined office, this instruction
cannot be given." However, Rule 1789 does not require the Registrar to receive
the instruction nor to act upon it for deregistration to take place; it is
sufficient for the instruction to be published in the Writ. I also note that
the rule does not require the Clerk of the Courts to identify or specify the
Registrar. The Rule simply requires the Clerk of the Courts to post the Writ
for the deregistration to be effective.

========================================================================

Panelist Maud's Arguments:

I concur with Justice Cecilius's arguments.  Rule 1789 does not
require the Registrar to exist in order for a Writ of FAGE to be
published, and it specifies that the named player be deregistered at
the moment the Writ is published.  Hence the decision of the Trial
Judge was incorrect.  Accordingly, I move to REVERSE the decision of
Judge Sherlock on CFJ 1594.
