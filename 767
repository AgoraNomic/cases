  Judged FALSE Wed, 17 May 1995 09:25:12 -0400 by elJefe
  --> elJefe receives 5 Points

======================================================================

Statement: 

"The Scorekeepor's report of April 24, 1995 is in error, in that the
Salaries as claimed to be received by Kelly, Andre and Steve are too
high."

Barred: Kelly

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Andre is said to have had a Salary of 8 points. However Rule 1040 clearly
states he has a Salary of 5 points. Rule 1007 defers to it. In my opinion
if 'XXX shall receive a Salary of 5 points' takes precedence over 'XXX shall
receive a Salary of 3 points' the resulting Salary should be 5 points, not 3.
For Kelly it's more or less the same, this time Rule 889 being the sole
responsible for eir salary.
Rule 910 states that Steve, as Justiciar, should not receive a Salary. This
Rule takes precedence over Rule 1007 which says e should.

       I have been told that when a large group of people believe in a
     fantasy, it is called a culture.  When a small group believes, it is
      called a cult.  When two people believe in a fantasy, it is called
         love; and when one person believes, it is called psychosis.

======================================================================

Judgement:  FALSE

The CFJ claims an error in the Scorekeepor's report of April 24, following
denial by the Scorekeepor of the associated Claim of Error. The claim is 
that the salaries received by Kelly, Andre and Steve are too high.

Rule 1007/0 states that "Officers ... shall receive a salary of 3 Points 
per week, unless another rule explicitly states another salary." Rules 889/0,
902/0, and 1040/0 award salaries of 5 Points to the CotC, Scorekeepor, and 
Banker, respectively. Rule 910/2 states that the Justiciar shall receive no 
weekly salary. Rule 1070/2 gives the Ambassador 2 Points per week as salary. 

The score report shows Kelly receiving 5 Points as CotC, 5 Points as 
Scorekeepor, and 2 Points as Ambassador, Andre receiving 3 Points as
Herald and 5 Points as Banker, and Steve receiving 5 Points as Assessor;
all these are reported as being awarded on 24 Apr 1995 at 00:00 GMT.

The argument is that the salaries should not amalgamate, but be treated
as a conflict in the definition of "salary" and that only one salary 
should be awarded, to be determined by the conflict resolution rules.

This is a little like saying that nobody should get F-A points because
Rule 312 (each player who Voted gets 1 Point at the end of the Voting 
Period) takes precedence over Rule 833 (when the voting period is over,
the proposer gets F-A points).  In fact, there is no conflict; both awards
can take place and do not interfere with each other.

Or, similarly, the claim that because the Voting Periods for a set of 
Proposals all refer to the same time span, voters get 1 Point regardless 
of how many proposals were voted upon.  This was disposed of in a recent
Claim of Error.

The use of the word "salary" indicates compensation for duties performed.
Its clear meaning is that the points received are tied to the Office held.
Each Office is associated with a separate salary, even if several are held 
by the same Player, just as each Proposal is associated with a separate 
Voting Period, even several share the same time span.

Rule 1007/0 does not clearly state that holders of multiple Offices receive 
multiple salaries, but it does not state the contrary either. The 
interpretation of the Scorekeepor, that they shall so receive them, is in 
accordance with Game Custom and common sense.  Thus Kelly's and Andre's
salaries, as reported, are clearly consistent with the Rules.

The statement in Rule 910/2 is rather interesting; it states that the 
Justiciar shall receive no salary.  If this is taken as actually forbidding
the player to receive Officer salaries, then (A.) it conflicts with
Rule 1007/0 paragraph 2, and (B.) does not explicitly state another salary 
than the default 3 Points.  Rule 910/2 claims precedence in such conflicts, 
and therefore Steve's salaries should total 8 Points.

On the other hand, if the interpretation is that it simply makes the
Justiciar salary 0 Points, then there is no conflict either with Rule 910/2 
or with the awarding of the Assessor salary.  This is the interpretation
I would endorse.  But in any case, it is not true that Steve's salary
is too high, as claimed.
