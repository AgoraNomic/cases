=======================================================================

Arguments:

My statement is a natural consequence of the interaction of 1530 and
1397.

The Reasoning is as follows.  Presume the existence of an Organization
that belongs to a Class nowhere referred to in the Rules.
According to 1530:

      "A Compact can only have Jurisdiction over Players permitted to
       it by the Rules governing its Class of Organization."

For this hypothetical Organization, no Rules exist that grant permission
for its Compact to have Jurisdiction over any Player. 1530 says "only"
players so permitted can be part of its Jurisdiction, so this
hypothetical Organization has a Compact that has a Jurisdiction that 
contains no Players.  In addition, because of this prohibition, this
Organization can _never_ expand its Jurisdiction beyond an empty set.

According to 1397:

     "An Organization ceases to exist when any of the following
      conditions become true:

        i) Its Compact ceases to have Jurisdiction over any Players
           and no provision exists for the Jurisdiction to expand."

Obviously, the strictures 1530 places on Organizations of undefined
Classes, all such Organizations fulfill clause i) of 1397 as soon as
they come into existence, and therefore, immediately cease to exist due
to 1397.


=======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge

Decision: FALSE

Reasoning:  Rule 1530 states that "A Compact can only have Jurisdiction over
            Players permitted to it by the Rules governing its Class of
            Organization."  An Organization of a Class not specifically
            defined in the Rules obviously has no Rule granting it Jurisdiction
            over any Players, so its Jurisdiction is the empty set of Players.
            As long as no Rule to grant Jurisdiction for this class exists,
            then the Jurisdiction remains the empty set.  However, it is the
            opinion of this Judge, that the passage of a Rule defining an
            Organization of the given class would expand the Jurisdiction
            of the Compact.  Thus I find that a provision to expand the
            Jurisdiction of the Compact does exist and hence, such a Compact
            is not required to dissolve under Rule 1397/2.



=======================================================================

Evidence:
Rule 1530/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Compacts: Jurisdiction

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's Compact is a subset of the
      set of all Players. A Compact has no force to require, or
      oblige, anything of Players who are not within its Jurisdiction.
      (This does not absolve any Players of duties required of them by
      the Rules.)

      Within its Jurisdiction, a Compact's ability to dictate Players'
      activity is limited to the extent permitted by the Rules.

      A Compact can only have Jurisdiction over Players permitted to
      it by the Rules governing its Class of Organization.

      No Compact may have effect prior to its Creation, nor may it
      have effect subsequent to its dissolution.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule governing
      Compacts.

Rule 1397/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Dissolution of Groups

      An Organization ceases to exist when any of the following
      conditions become true:

        i) Its Compact ceases to have Jurisdiction over any Players
           and no provision exists for the Jurisdiction to expand.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would result in
           the absence of a Administrator (and/or the absence of an
           Executor in the case of a Orginization with Treasuries)
           with no provision for any Player to fulfill the role(s).
      iii) The Organization is required to dissolve in accordance with
           its Compact or the Rules.

      At the moment an Organization dissolves, the following occurs,
      in order.

        i) Any Currencies remaining in the Organization's Treasuries
           (if such exist) are distributed as provided for by other
           Rules.
       ii) All Players cease to be within the Jurisdiction of the
           Organization's Compact.
      iii) The Organization's Treasuries, Compact, and the
           Organization itself, cease to exist.

      Whenever a Public Organization dissolves, the Notary shall
      report that event to the Public Forum As Soon As Possible after
      e is notified as required by other Rules.

      Other Rules may define additional causes of dissolution.
