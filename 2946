On 6939, I specify that PRESENT counts as a valid option (see Rule
693), vote PRESENT, and resolve it as follows:
  * omd voted ADOPTED
  * Murphy voted PRESENT
  * As permitted by Rule 955 (c), I choose PRESENT as the outcome

(Who says you have a monopoly on abusing language?)

========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

Regardless of
whether you can specify PRESENT to be a valid option like that or not,
the purported resolution was incorrect; for if both PRESENT and ADOPTED
were valid options, the decision would have failed quorum. Thus, there's
no circumstance under which PRESENT was the actual outcome.
