======================================================================

Statement:

"Swann violated Rule 1446 by not transfering all his points and
Currencies to the No More Contests Contest Fund and by not going On
Hold within an hour after creating his own revengeful Contest."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

The Contestmaster of a Contest has to obey the Regulations of
that Contest, according to Rule 1446. By creating a Contest with
the name of `Revenge for TAL' in the message with datestamp
  Date: Thu, 6 Apr 1995 04:04:15 -0400
Swann became the Contestmaster of the No More Contests Contest,
according to its Regulation 5:
  Reg. 5:  In case any player legally creates a Contest, that player
           replaces the current Contestmaster, and becomes the new
           Contestmaster.

But Regulation 6 stipulates:
  Reg. 6:  Anyone becoming Contestmaster via Reg. 5 must within one
           hour both go On Hold, and transfer all eir currencies and
           Points to the Contest Fund.

As Swann did not made this transfer, nor went On Hold, he is violating
Rule 1446, that states that Regulations must be obeyed by Contest
masters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge, if e agrees with my Statement, issues
Injunctions to the effect that
1) Swann's Formal Apology includes 10 Prescribed Words.
 I propose the following ten words:
 I, shall, not, create, Contests, before, reading, all, my, mail

2) the illegal Moves of *not* going On Hold and *not* transfering all
currencies to the NMC Contest Fund are retracted; and that the
Game State is adjusted such that
- Swann is On Hold
- he holds no points and no currencies
- said points and currencies are held by the NMC Contest Fund

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References (Rule 665, 908, 1446;
            the message to the Forum creating the Revenge for TAL
             Contest;
            the regulations of the NMC Contest)

Rule 665/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.


Rule 908/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Formal Apologies

      If a Call for Judgement alleges that a Player (herein called the
      Ninny) has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE,
      then the Ninny must submit to the Public Forum a Formal Apology
      within 72 hours of the publication of Judgement, unless that
      Judgement is successfully appealed within 72 hours.

      By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at least 200 words,
      con-taining all of the Prescribed Words (if any were prescribed)
      ex-plaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      A Judge deciding TRUE in such a CFJ may issue an Injunction
      including a list of up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's
      choice, and ordering that the Ninny's Formal Apology must
      include the Prescribed Words.

      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall gain 3 Blots.

      The Player who called the initial CFJ has the duty to report to
      the Tabulator any Blots gained through this rule.

Rule 1446/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      A contest is a subgame of Agora Nomic, having its own Name,
      Entry Fee, Regulations, Contestmaster, and Contest Fund.

      It is created when a Player posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations.
      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      score changes and currency transfers taking place under the
      Regulations, administers the Contest Fund, and maintains the
      Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is an entity capable of owning, trading, and
      spending Points or Currencies in the same manner as a Player,
      but only as authorized by the Regulations.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        - how the Contestmaster is replaced,
        - how currencies and Points are transferred to or from the
          Contest Fund,
        - the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, which shall be
          in Points,
        - additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
        - how the Regulations may be changed, and
        - ways for the Contest to be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or as otherwise provided in the
      rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants.

      If according to the Regulations the Contest Fund must transfer
      Points and/or currency to a Contestant, and the Fund does not
      have sufficient resources, then enough of the Contestmaster's
      Points and/or currency are transferred to the Fund to cover the
      transaction.

      If e does not have sufficient Points or currency to accomplish
      this, then each Contestant is given back eir entry fee, and the
      Contestmaster loses the number of Points of the returned entry
      fees. The Contest is then dissolved.

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

      This transfer is not taxable.  This Rule takes precedence over
      all other Rules which determine which Point and Currency
      transfers are legal and/or taxable, or which would assign Blots
      to any Player.

Nice, this may work.  If it does, I propose the following contest:

Revenge for TAL:

1) The Contestmaster of this contest is TAL
2) All points and Currencies owned by the Contestmaster are
   immediatly transfered to the Contest Fund.
3) All points and Currencies recieved by the Contestmaster
   are immediatly transfered into the Contest Fund.
4) These regulations cannot be changed.
5) The Contestmaster may not Change
6) No one may win this Contest

Take that.

======================================================================

Judgement:  FALSE

Arguments:

In order to determine the truth or falsity of TAL's Statement, we must
determine the Truth or Falsity of the following specific points:

1) The No More Contests Contest (NMC) was a legal Contest via Rule
1446.

2) That the NMC Regulations can, via Rule 1446, require a Player to 
involuntarily become Contestmaster of NMC and legally force that 
Player, via Rule 1446, to transfer all eir points and Currencies to the 
NMC Contest Fund and force that Player to go On Hold.

3) That a violation of Contest Regulations is a Violation of Rule 1446.

4) That my posting crated a valid legal Contest, via rule 1446.

5) That a Contest Creation via point 4) invoked the particular 
Regulations of the NMC referred to in point 2)

6) That my failure to transfer Points, Currencies or and On Hold was a 
violation of the NMC Regulations, and via point 4) a violation of Rule 
1446.

All six items must be valid and true in order for TAL's Statement to be 
true.  I will address each in turn before rendering a Judgement.

Point 1)

Rule 1446/0 states:

"A Contest is created when a Player Posts to the Public Forum an 
announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations."

NMC fulfills this requirement, it was posted to the Public Forum with a 
Name and a list of Regulations, therefore it was legally Created.


Point 2)

>From the NMC Regs:
" Reg. 5:  In case any player legally creates a Contest, that player
           replaces the current Contestmaster, and becomes the new
           Contestmaster.
  
  Reg. 6:  Anyone becoming Contestmaster via Reg. 5 must within one
           hour both go On Hold, and transfer all eir currencies and
           Points to the Contest Fund.  E may not come Off Hold until
           this Contest is dissolved.  Anyone becoming Contestmaster
           for the second time via Reg. 5 must immediately forfeit the
           game of Agora Nomic."

This is more problematic.  First, can a Contest force a Player to 
become a Contestmaster?  Apparently so, since there is no provision 
within 1446/0, or elsewhere in the rules to prevent it.

Next in order of events, can the regulations of that Contest then force 
a Player to go On Hold?

>From 1446/0:

     "The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules."

Does requiring someone to go on Hold conflict with the Rules?  It 
doesn't seem to conflict with 1016/2, which only forbids a Player from 
putting someone other than eimself on Hold.  So far, so good.

Now that the Player is on Hold, can e transfer currencies and/or points 
to the NMC Contest fund as required?  Well, Rule 692/2 says nothing 
preventing a Player On Hold from Trading Points.  And Rule 614/1 
likewise only refers to Players, not Active Players.  Thus these events 
can be mandated, in the order in which they are mandated.


There is, however, an interesting wrinkle to this:

>From 1016/2:

     "While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge

      This rule takes precedence over any rule giving special duties
      to a particular player or a particular group of players."

Note that this rule absolves the Player on Hold from *all duties* once 
e goes on Hold.  This *includes* the duty of Contestmaster.  Therefore, 
the Contestmaster referred to in Reg 6 of NMC Regs has ceased to be 
Contestmaster by the time the first comma is reached.  The one 
immediate side effect of this is the fact that once the Contestmaster 
goes On Hold, as required, the NMC Regs cease to be binding, since e is 
no longer the Contestmaster.

Side Effect one: E can come off of Hold immediately, since the 
restriction about remaining on Hold until the Contest is dissolved is 
non-binding on someone who is not the Contestmaster.

Side Effect two: The Contestmaster must be immediately replaced to 
fulfill the balance of Reg 6 (the Point and Currency Transfer) *or* 
Rule 1446/0 mandates the dissolution of a Contestmasterless Contest.

Can the Contestmaster be replaced?  Unfortunately, no.  The NMC Regs 
only provide explicitly for a Contestmaster forfeiting, or 
deregistering.  So, once Reg 6 is invoked, the NMC contest ceases to 
exist once the Contestmaster goes on Hold.  Because of the order of 
events, the point/currency transfer need not take place as mandated.  
If the Contestmaster Goes on Hold first, as written, the requirement 
ceases to be operative.


Point 3)

Again From 1446/0:

     "The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules."

A violation of the Regs is a violation of 1446/0, provided the Regs do 
not violate the Rules.


Point 4)

Rule 1446/0 states:

     "A Contest is created when a Player Posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations."

My post contained a name, "Revenge for TAL" (RFT) and a list of 
regulations, and was posted in the Public Forum.  However, it contained 
the conditional phrasing:

"Nice, this may work.  If it does, I propose the following contest:"

This is referring to TAL's "Make another Contestmaster" (MAC) Contest.  
However, the goal of the MAC contest was to transfer 90% of the Points 
from the Player with the highest score to TAL.  This did not work.  So 
the condition of this phrase was not met.

Was this conditional phrasing legal?

Unfortunately, (for me) I think not.  According to the wording, a 
Contest becomes a Contest when the announcement appears.  This 
announcement appeared long before the "work/not work" question was 
answered definitively.  Since the conditional phrase was not part of 
the RFT Regs, it had no effect once the Contest was formed.


Point 5)

I legally created the RFT Contest by posting my message.

>From the NMC Regs:

 "Reg. 5:  In case any player legally creates a Contest, that player
           replaces the current Contestmaster, and becomes the new
           Contestmaster."

TAL was then the Contestmaster of NMC, thus I replaced TAL and TAL 
Ceased being the Contestmaster of NMC.

>From the RFT Regs:

"1) The Contestmaster of this contest is TAL."

Upon my becoming Contestmaster of NMC, TAL became Contestmaster of RFT.


Point 6)

TAL's Statement:

"Swann violated Rule 1446 by not transferring all his points and
Currencies to the No More Contests Contest Fund and by not going On
Hold within an hour after creating his own revengeful Contest."

Now I am supposed to judge the truth or falsity of this statement.
According to my reasoningthus far, I could have satisfied the rules 
simply by going on Hold and dissolving the NMC contest.  But this 
statement explicitly states that my violation was in not doing *both* 
the transfer *and* going On Hold.  Not only that, but the wording of 
this Statement is in precisely the opposite order of that required in 
NMC Reg 6.

I must therefore come to an implicit Point 7)

Is it *possible* for me to Judge this Statement TRUE?

The fact is, if I judge this statement TRUE, I am to issue an
Injunction that I am on Hold, and have been since an hour after I
became the Contestmaster of NMC. If I issue that Injunction,  I am on
Hold and I am ineligible to issue that Injunction.  If I am ineligible 
to issue that Injunction, that Injunction has no effect, I am not on 
Hold.  If I am not on Hold, I am mandated to issue that Injunction.

It is impossible, due to this logical paradox, for me to issue a 
Judgement of TRUE.

UNDECIDABLE is reserved for paradoxical Statements, not paradoxical 
Judgements.

There is simply not enough ambiguity in this Statement, or in the Rules, for me 
to Judge UNKNOWN.

After weighing each possible Judgement available to me, and bending over 
backwards to avoid even an appearance of bias in my own favor, I am only left 
with one possible decision, FALSE.  In the end, this Judgement is based on a 
strict reading of the unconditional nature of the Statement, not necessarily in 
the intended argument.

Rule 1016/2 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Putting Oneself on Hold

      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by sending
      a message indicating such to the Public Forum.  A Player may not
      place any other Player besides emself on Hold.  A Player may
      cease to be On Hold by sending a message indicating such to the
      Public Forum, so long as it has been at least 96 hours since e
      last went On Hold.

      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge

      This rule takes precedence over any rule giving special duties
      to a particular player or a particular group of players.

Trading Points

      A Player may voluntarily transfer Points to any other Player for

       (a) the transfer must be posted to the Public Forum
       (b) a Player may only transfer a positive number of Points

Legal Judgements

      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, UNDECIDABLE, or
      UNKNOWN.  The Judgement of UNDECIDABLE is reserved for those
      statements which are logically neither TRUE nor FALSE.  The
      Judgement of UNKNOWN is for those statements for which the
      Judge is unable to obtain information necessary to determine
      whether the statement is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE.

      The Judge must make a reasonable effort to obtain all
      information necessary to determine whether the statement
      is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE.

      The Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments,
      which include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely
      invalid.

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

      Any evidence which is used to justify the Judgement, other than
      appeals to Game Custom or to common sense, must be presented by
      the Judge.  If the Judge introduces evidence beyond that
      submitted in the Call for Judgement, e must include this
      evidence in eir Judgement.  All such added evidence must be
      distributed as part of the reasons and arguments by the Clerk of
      the Courts.

       I have been told that when a large group of people believe in a
     fantasy, it is called a culture.  When a small group believes, it is
      called a cult.  When two people believe in a fantasy, it is called
	 love; and when one person believes, it is called psychosis.
