Caller's Arguments:

Rule 2663/0 (Bird Migration) professes to empower the buying of bird food
as a fee-based action:

>      A player CAN buy bird food by paying a fee of 5 boatloads of
>      coins.

As defined in Rule 2579/3 (Fee-based Actions), any fee is a simultaneous
pair of actions (transferring the funds and performing the action are
explicitly simultaneous by that rule).

Importantly, while the power=3 Rule fee-based actions *defines* what
happens for a fee, it doesn't actually empower any transfers (no CANs and
so forth).  Therefore, it is Rule 2663/0 that empowers the simultaneous
actions of transferring coins and buying bird food.

Unfortunately, simultaneous actions are secured-2, so the power-1 R2663
can't do this, due to R478/40:
>      Allowing actions performed by
>      sending a message to take place simultaneously must be done
>      explicitly and is secured at power 2.


Caller's Evidence:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2663/0 (Power=1) [excerpt]
Bird Migration

      A player CAN buy bird food by paying a fee of 5 boatloads of
      coins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2579/3 (Power=3)
Fee-based Actions

      If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the
      fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
      action, that method for performing that action is a fee-based
      method.

      If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a fungible asset, the
      actual fee is the next highest integer amount of that asset.

      To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
      permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
      the action; the announcement must specify the correct set of
      assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for the
      sole purpose of using that method to perform that action.

      Upon such an announcement:

        - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
          CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
          then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
          and the action is performed simultaneously;

        - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
          destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee in
          eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
          simultaneously.

        - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
          action is not performed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 478/40 (Power=3) [excerpt]
Fora

 sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.

      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified. Allowing actions performed by
      sending a message to take place simultaneously must be done
      explicitly and is secured at power 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

This breaks down into two parts: allowing actions performed by sending a
message to take place, and allowing simultaneity of said events. Only
the latter is restricted by Rule 478, so Rule 2663 covers the former and
Rule 2579 covers the latter. This is in line with the spirit of Rule 217
(Interpreting the Rules):

                Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
       common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
       higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
       clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
       clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
       changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
       causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
       with its text.

A hypothetical power<2 rule with text such as "A player CAN by
announcement simultaneously transfer two widgets to two different
players" would probably still allow the transfers, they would just be
sequential rather than simultaneous, presumably in the order that the
two players were listed. If they were specified simultaneously, e.g.
"the two players satisfying <condition>", then presumably the old
standard of "still works as long as it makes no substantive difference
which order is chosen" would still apply as game custom.

I judge TRUE.
