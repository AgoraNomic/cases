Caller's Evidence:

and:

I pointed the most Fingers that lead to a Warning/Indictment/CHoJ last
week (two Unjustified Gesticulations were resolved this way last
Sunday; the previous such Finger resolution was the Sunday previous).
Additionally, I am Compliance-focused. I didn't grant myself a Justice
Card using my focus earlier this month, nor a Justice Card using
finger-point resolutions earlier this week.


Caller's Arguments:

The rules state that I CAN perform the action of granting myself a
Justice Card by announcement. Rule 2624 says that I CAN do this. Rule
2478 also says that I CAN do this. There's no contradiction there;
rather, the rules are in agreement with each other, and as such I CAN
do it.

They are somewhat less clear, however, about what the consequences of
doing so are. Rule 2624 permits the action to be performed once per
month. Rule 2478 is a little ambiguous, but most people interpret it as
allowing the action to be performed once per relevant week. Are these
rules contradicting each other with regards to how often the action can
be performed? Or are they defining two different actions? If so, which
one did I take? (Both?) There doesn't seem to be a requirement in the
rules to state which rule permits me to take a particular action, in
order to perform it by announcement.

On the other hand, rule 2624 is a little more general than rule 2478
when it comes to specifying the parameters of the action; rule 2624
allows me to grant the Justice Card to anyone, and 2478 only to myself.
(Does that matter? If so, how?) The statement of this CFJ therefore
depends on whether rule 2624 still permits me to take the action (as
opposed to rule 2478).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge G.'s Arguments:

The rules text governing by-announcement actions (R478/40) is:
      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.

The question is whether the creation of a justice card as permitted by
Rule 2624/8:
      A player CAN once a month grant eir Ministry Focus' Grant [defined
      elsewhere in the rule as 1 Justice Card for the Caller] to a
      specified player by announcement.
is the "same action", for the purposes of specifying and setting forth
intent to perform "that action", as the creation of a justice card
permitted by R2478/20:
      The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings that resulted
      in a Warning, Indictment, or Cold Hand of Justice in the previous
      Agoran Week CAN once grant emself a Justice Card by
      announcement.

I find that these are two separate actions for the purposes of R478 by-
announcement specifications.  In particular, the surrounding conditions in
each rule, and the clear, common-sense rules-indication that "once" means
"once after the [each different] specific trigger conditions", means these
are accounted separately and have different side-effects (i.e. counting
against different limits), and are therefore different actions for the
purpose of specification.

Therefore, any attempt to merely grant a card to oneself, when either rule
is a POSSIBLE conduit, is ambiguous and fails due to being an incomplete
or ambiguous specification.  Whether it is done by focus or by
finger-pointing must be part of the announcement.  This can be contextual
and loose (replying to the Ministor's report versus the Referee's report)
but it must be somehow indicated.

To date, it's likely that a few haven't been indicated - if a player at a
given moment can only use one of the methods, it's quite *possible* that
this enough "context" to allow it to work.  But this current CFJ is not
covering that situation, and the degree of context needed should be
considered on a case-by-case basis.

In this case, then, I find TRUE, because the attempt to grant a card
failed entirely, and did not count against either of the creation limits
in either rule.
