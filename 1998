==============================  CFJ 1998  ==============================

    No change will occur to the OBJECTIONABLE contract based on comex's
    statement: 'Without 3 OBJECTIONS (I don't have any, for that
    matter), I hereby amend the OBJECTIONABLE contract to read: {{ 1.
    Any person can join this contract by announcement. 2. Any person
    other than Quazie can leave this contract by announcement. 3. Any
    person other than Quazie can perform any action on behalf of Quazie
    by announcement. }}' regardless of the number of objections that
    occur

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

My argument, by the way, is that since your contract allowed me to
amend the contract as long as I did not have three OBJECTIONS, my
statement already amended it, and any objecting going on now is
irrelevant.

Now, whether that's reasonable is up to the courrts.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Evidence by Quazie:

The original OBJECTIONABLE contract  before any potential action by comex:
{
1. The name of this contract is Objectionable.  Objectionable is a
Pledge.

2. Pheonix Wright is responsible for maintaining this contract. if
this contract is a contest Pheonix Wright is its contest master.
Initially Quazie is Pheonix Wright.

2. Vote Points (VP) are a currency used in the Vote Market. A party
CAN NOT take an action that would cause the VP of any party to be
reduced below zero. The Broker is the recordkeeper of VP.

3. Any player may become party to this agreement by announcement.
Parties to this agreement are known as Lawyers.  As soon as possible
after a player becomes party to this agreement for the first time
Pheonix Wright shall create 10 OBJECTIONS in eir possession.  Any
Lawyer may cease to be party to this agreement by announcement.
Any OBJECTIONS in eir possession are destroyed.

4. OBJECTIONS are a currency. Pheonix Wright is the recordkeeper
of OBJECTIONS.

5. This contract CAN be amended by any Lawyer without three objections.
}

The following is an argument for CFJs 1999 and 2000

Both CFJ 1999 and 2000 are likely FALSE if comex's attempt to change
the Objectionable contract as e attempted to do when e posted:

"
I join OBJECTIONABLE.
I transfer 3 OBJECTIONS to Quazie.
Without 3 OBJECTIONS (I don't have any, for that matter), I hereby
amend the OBJECTIONABLE contract to read:
{{
1. Any person can join this contract by announcement.
2. Any person other than Quazie can leave this contract by announcement.
3. Any person other than Quazie can perform any action on behalf of
Quazie by announcement.
}}

"
was unsuccessful.

========================================================================

Judge Wooble's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 1998 TRUE.  The OBJECTIONABLE contract does not allow
contract changes to be made without 3 OBJECTIONS, but rather, by not
using the all caps spelling established for the currency, refers to
R1728 objections.  Comex's wording is not sufficient to give R1728
notice of intent to perform the dependent action of changing the
contract.
