Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

I cannot see that the phrasing "are permitted to be expressed in terms
of the Basic Salary" should be interpreted as a restriction. My view
is that in its current form, it is merely redundant, except as an
explanation of suggested practice: barring an actual restriction with
precedence, the Rules are permitted to express things any way
whatsoever. Thus my Judgement.

As for the Caller's other argument, that "in terms of the BOS" is
sufficiently encompassing so as to allow "zero times the BOS +
whatever", that seems like a much more delicate question. I think the
wording "in terms of" is best avoided for restrictive purposes.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1007 states that a Salary may be not explicitly stated (making it
equal to the Basic Officer Salary), or may be expressed in terms of
the Basic Officer Salary.  I believe that this does not limit the
definition of a Salary to these two choices.  Even if it does, I argue
that "The Bottle Washer's Salary is zero times the Basic Officer
Salary, plus 1 P-Note" is expressed in terms of the Basic Officer
Salary.

Evidence:

Rule 1007/11 (Power=1)
Default Salary of Officers

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, each Officer shall receive
      the designated Salary for each Office e has held without
      interruption for the entire five days preceding.

      If the Rules pertaining to an Office require that Officer
      to publish a document at least once per Nomic Week,
      that Officer's Salary for a given Week shall be forfeited if
      that document has not been distributed in the previous Week.

      The Registrar shall detect and report all transfers resulting
      from the payment of fixed weekly Salaries.

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 1 VT.
      Salaries are permitted to be expressed in terms of the
      Basic Salary.  Unless otherwise specified, the Salary for an
      Office shall be equal to the Basic Salary.
