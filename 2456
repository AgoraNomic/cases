========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

"If you take the view that any caste flip that would have been illegal for
the Grand Poobah was IMPOSSIBLE for me as a deputy, I still made several
legal changes as part of a single "promotion procedure A" that I deputized
to perform:

Starting conditions:
  Alpha:  [none]
   Beta:  Billy Pilgrim
  Gamma:  j, OscarMeyr, Pavitra, Taral, woggle, Wooble
  Delta:  cmealerjr, Murphy, root
Epsilon:  BobTHJ, comex, coppro, Craig, Dvorak Herring, ehird, Elysion,
            harblcat, pikhq, Schrodinger's Cat, Sgeo, Siege, Sir Toby,
            Spitemaster, Tiger, w1n5t0n, Warrigal, Yally; PNP, ais523,
            Rodlen, Goethe
 Savage:  Bayes, HP2, Normish, PBA

Following that, this worked:
> A.1.a:  I flip Billy Pilgrim's caste to Alpha.
Then the rest of the flips-to-alpha failed, they were part of illegal
therefore impossible-for-me-to-deputize-to-perform procedures.

Then, in this list:
> I flip each of the following players' castes to Beta: [list]
the first occurrence of a gamma in the list would have worked to satisfy
A.1.b, so j would have been flipped to beta (the rest failing).

Then in this list:
> I flip each of the following players' castes to Gamma: [list]
the first occurrence of a delta in the list would have worked to satisfy
A.1.c, so cmealerjr would have been flipped to gamma (the rest failing).

Then finally in this list:
> I flip each of the following players' castes to Delta: [list]
the first occurrence of an epsilon in the list would have worked to satisfy
A.1.d, so BobTHJ would have been flipped to delta.

Everything else failed, as the next required step would be a demotion of
too many gammas to deltas, and that didn't happen after the last promotion
above.  So the end product would be that a set of promotions worked, but no
demotions, leaving:

  Alpha:  Billy Pilgrim
   Beta:  j
  Gamma:  OscarMeyr, Pavitra, Taral, woggle, Wooble, cmealerjr
  Delta:  Murphy, root, BobTHJ
Epsilon:  comex, coppro, Craig, Dvorak Herring, ehird, Elysion,
            harblcat, pikhq, Schrodinger's Cat, Sgeo, Siege, Sir Toby,
            Spitemaster, Tiger, w1n5t0n, Warrigal, Yally; PNP, ais523,
            Rodlen, Goethe
 Savage:  Bayes, HP2, Normish, PBA

And a set of demotions due (but all April promotions completed)."

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

Goethe did not successfully become Grand Poobah
on April 1, although I don't know if that affects anything.

========================================================================

Judge root's Arguments:

First, to dispense with comex's gratuitous arguments: the action in
question was attempted by deputisation, prior to Goethe's attempt to
become Grand Poobah.  That the latter attempt failed is not relevant
here.

Goethe's arguments here seem reasonable to me.  In opposition, it has
been suggested that R2211 requires the sequence of actions it defines
to be performed all at once, not split into separate messages or
interleaved with other actions, successful or not.  However, R2211
does not explicitly support this view, and to read it implicitly is, I
think, against Agoran custom.

As evidence for this custom, I offer a sequence of messages dating
back to May 2005.  Rule 2083/1 defined an official 4-step procedure,
not unlike the one in R2211, that the Deckmastor was required to use
when it was necessary to enforce hand sizes.  In the messages in
question, Deckmastor Goethe performed the first two steps in one
message, shuffled the deck in a second message (necessary, but not
part of the R2083 procedure), then finally performed the last two
steps in a third message.  I can find no record that any challenge to
this split performance of duties was made at the time.  The rule text
and the messages are reproduced in the evidence section.

In light of this, I see no convincing argument as to why Goethe's
attempt to promote j to Beta might have failed.  I enter a judgement
of TRUE in CFJ 2456.

========================================================================

Judge root's Evidence:

Rule 2083/1

      As soon as possible after any gambler's hand becomes frozen, the
      Deckmastor shall perform the following actions in order:

      1) Calculate and publicly announce the Card Tax for each frozen
         gambler.  The Card Tax for a frozen gambler is equal to the
         hand size of that gambler less the minimum hand size.  The
         Card Tax shall be calculated as of the moment the gambler's
         hand became frozen.

      2) From every frozen gambler in turn, transfer cards selected at
         random from that gambler's hand to the Deck until eir hand
         size has been reduced by an amount not less than eir Card Tax
         or e has no cards remaining.

      3) If the hands were frozen because of a win, deal cards to the
         winner until eir hand size has been increased by the maximum
         hand size less the minimum hand size, calculated as of the
         moment the winner's hand became frozen.

      4) Publicly announce that the table is open for business.

      Upon publication of an announcement as in 4), the Flux of every
      gambler shall become free.  If the Deckmastor makes a public
      announcement as in 4) when one or more gamblers are frozen but
      steps 1), 2), and 3) have not been completed, then the
      announcement is still valid, but the Deckmastor must complete
      steps 1), 2), and 3) as soon as possible.  If the Deckmastor's
      error is not made in good faith, then e commits the Class 4
      Crime of Stacking the Deck.

The starred Discard Picking may not be in the Discard Pile, so
that transfer may have failed.  (Since it is fungible with the
other Discard Picking, it is definitely that last one that may
have failed).  Either way, the Discard Pile is down to two cards.

The previous transfers from the Library to the Deck also failed,
because they didn't take into account the Blueprints.  Since the
Blueprints are destroyed, I now transfer the following cards from
the Library to the Deck:

Distrib-u-Matic, Patronage, Procedure, Policy, Coalition

I have no legal choice, really.  After pondering probabilities, I
must do as follows.

The following five deals are only legal deals in the gamestate in
which Sherlock holds a Discard Picking card:

I deal Dud to The Library
I deal Divide or Conquer Your Stock to The Library
I deal Divide or Conquer Your Stock to The Library
I deal Coalition to The Library
I deal Library Renewal to The Library

The following five deals are only legal deals in the gamestate in
which Sherlock holds a One Share card:

I deal Distrib-u-Matic to The Library
I deal Procedure to The Library
I deal Debate-o-Matic to The Library
I deal Raffle Ticket to The Libary
I deal Divide or Conquer Your Stock to The Library

THE TABLE is OPEN for BUSINESS (both gamestates).

The following five deals are only legal deals in the gamestate in
which Sherlock holds a Discard Picking card:

I deal Instant Punishment to root.
I deal Not Your Turn to Quazie.
I deal Raffle Ticket to root.
I deal Distrib-u-Matic to Quazie.
I deal Divide or Conquer Your Stock to root.

The following five deals are only legal deals in the gamestate in
which Sherlock holds a One Share card:

I deal Debate-o-Matic to root.
I deal Discard Picking to Quazie.
I deal Debate-o-Matic to root.
I deal Absolve-o-matic to Quazie.
I deal Thieves in the Night to root.
