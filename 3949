Caller's Arguments:

It was sent to a service that all players were able
to access, but it would've only been available to members that were
online between the original sending and the edit, so I question whether
it was sent *to* any player that wasn't online at the time at all. Even
if it was, I question whether a designation is "clear" if it's
intentionally hidden from the recipient by being completely removed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

For a short period of time (at least long enough for ais523 to receive
it via the IRC bridge and inform Jason of same), the message did contain
a clear designation of intent to be public (using those exact words, in
fact).

The message was later edited to become unclear, but the CFJ says
"contained" and not "contains", so that doesn't matter here.

While the judgement of CFJ 3948 is sufficient to block repetitions of
this type of attempt, we may still want to review the rules on messages
in light of fora such as Discord that allow messages to be sent to
others, but then edited and/or removed, without routinely leaving the
sender's technical domain of control (you *can* download a local copy of
Discord messages, but it's not nearly as routine as receiving e-mail;
@mentions trigger notifications that are somewhat closer to e-mail, but
more fragile).

I judge CFJ 3949 TRUE.
