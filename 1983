Caller's Arguments:

"Hello!" is not a statement, thus the attempt to file the CFJ in the first
place failed because the information required under rule 591 was not given (to
be
precise, the statement being CFJd on). It is a sentence, but is an
interjection, not
a statement. So the CFJ never existed, and therefore I suspect FALSE.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

There is reasonable support for interpreting "statement" broadly;
some definitions supporting this interpretation are provided as
evidence.  I also believe that the task of parsing and interpreting
statements should generally (Rule 2204 is an exception) be assigned
to the judge, rather than the Clerk of the Courts; interpreting
"statement" broadly is consistent with this belief; see also CFJs
1266 and 1883-84.
