Caller's Arguments:

I suggest the judge allow any Partner to act on behalf of comex and of
any partner who votes against my Perlnomic proposal to expel em from
the game of perlnomic to deregister them at any time in the next 5
years.  Eir conduct has turned the opinion of the other players of
Agora so firmly against the PNP (and even partnerships in general)
that any other punishment would be incredibly inequitable and unjust.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

According to ais523, Wooble assumes that e is the only one
adding proposals to PerlNomic, and if a PerlNomic player records a
proposal, there is a good chance of its being distributed twice.  The
PerlNomic metarules ( http://nomic.info/perlnomic/metarules.txt )
explicitly mention taking advantage of bugs and loopholes.  While my
distribution wasn't strictly a PN bug, I'd say that it's at least
somewhat envisioned by the metarules; nobody, however, envisioned that
one player would unilaterally take over the PNP's duties, rather than
their being performed collectively.  In light of this, I think a
reasonably equitable resolution would have the PNP resign as Promotor
and nominate Wooble, who deserves the salary and can ensure that no
false statements about the proposal pool are made.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by woggle:

The PerlNomic Partnership does not incorporate the metarules
explicitly, and it's hard to read it as incorporating the metarules
implicitly except as governing the procedure for becoming or ceasing to
be a PerlNomicite and determining what exactly is a mechanism of the
PerlNomic game. The judge should therefore not consider the metarules as
a major factor in eir decision on this case.

I think I've said enough.

========================================================================

Judge Taral's Arguments:

Looks like the brouhaha has died down. Given that the PNP contract
itself provides no restriction or obligation on comex to do/not do
this kind of thing, I enter the empty judgement in Equity Case 2436.
Refer to your metarules in the contract if you want the court to
enforce them.

========================================================================

Appellant Wooble's Arguments:

"The PerlNomicites shall ensure that the PerlNomic Partnership obeys
   the Rules of Agora to the maximum possible extent."

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Rodlen:

This was truly a mess.  Comex was apparently not guilty of the thing that
caused this equity case.  However, he did cause it, leading to the PNP's
loss of an office and much reputation damage.  I got help with this thing,
and it turns out that Comex isn't a member of Perlnomic at the moment.  And
that he isn't planning on joining.  Seeing how the PNP is the Perlnomic
Partnership, Comex shouldn't really be part of it.

So now I have to decide on something.  Empty would make sense, due to things
like Comex's innocence, but it doesn't make up for the damages.  However,
seeing how Comex isn't part of Perlnomic at this time...

Weakening the connection between Comex and the PNP should help the PNP's
reputation.  With thanks to ais523, I would like to suggest the following
judgment:

Until May 28, 2009, it is ILLEGAL for Comex to join the PNP.

How does that sound to the parties?

========================================================================

Judge Rodlen's Arguments:

Until May 28, 2009, it is ILLEGAL for Comex to join the PNP.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Wooble:

I approve this judgement.
