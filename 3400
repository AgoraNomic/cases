I find the thought that Agora maybe just accidentally ended hilarious.
Almost so much that I want it to be true. But I think we're safe. The
game of agora, and of nomics in general, is well-established as not
being a normal game. Thus when the only indication we have of an
ending is the text "wins the game", I think it's justified to say that
the rules are silent, as per 217. Then game custom and the good of the
game says it did not just end. Add in 1023(b)(5) the 2nd, which says
"game" is sometimes used as a time period, and I think we've moved up
from the rules being "silent" to them being "unclear".

Judge woggle's Arguments [prior to reconsideration]:

I judge CFJ 3400 FALSE.

There are multiple interpretations for what happens to a game when someone
"wins": sometimes play continues for future rounds to determine other winners
or for other purposes (second place, just to see what would happen); sometimes
the game ceases.

Although, we have removed our most explicit guidance in the rules on this
issue, any interpretation that disables the proposal system -- a large and
essential part of the Agoran game -- would contravene Rule 1698 (Agora Is A
Nomic). In addition, Rule 2419 specifies a cleanup procedure that is short of
"ending the game" -- "all players' scores are reset to 0" -- strongly implying
that play continues. And, as Rule 1698 seems to codify a consensus on the
"best interest of the game", interpretations that do not end the game would be
preferred per Rule 217.

Even if we were to interpret "win the game" as requiring gameplay to otherwise
cease, this action would be beyond the power of the Power-1 Rule 2419. Much of
Agora's gameplay is defined at Power > 1 and the rules allowing such gameplay
to continue would take precedence per Rule 1030. (And "winning the game"
cannot implicitly do any rule changes, because such rule changes would be
ambiguous.)


Gratuitous Arguments by Fool:

I intend with two support to file a motion to reconsider. Even if this
does not change the outcome, I would prefer that the counter-arguments
be addressed.

This was anticipated and argued against, I believe it was by Alex. The
game isn't ossified, it doesn't exist.

This was anticipated by me. How can one possibly invoke "best interests
of the game" in this case?

The opposite, as I said! It has the power to award a win, it does not
have the power to override the common-sense meanings of the words.

I just remembered that the ruleset has long used "wins the game"
without a specific note that doing so does not cause Agora to end
(look at any recent ruleset before Proposal 7039 in May 2011).  So
this whole thing is silly: if Agora would have ended a few days ago,
then it ended a long time ago.  In fact, that proposal was a response
to basically this exact issue being adjudicated:

http://cotc.psychose.ca/viewcase.php?cfj=2987

Indeed, the original Rule 203 stated that "a game ends" when someone wins:

http://agora.qoid.us/www.fysh.org/%7ezefram/agora/chuck0_nr_19930630.txt

Even if Rule 2419 caused "the game", whatever that means, to end, and
platonically started a new game based on the same gamestate (which
would necessarily follow from the "all scores reset" clause), that's
nothing new.


Judge woggle's Arguments [following reconsideration]:

I will assign the same judgment of FALSE.

As far as I can tell, these are the issues that people would like resolved
with my prior judgment:

(a) whether my ruling was based on the meaning of "win the game", or was based
on R2419 having insufficient.

The primary basis of my judgment is that, in the Agoran tradition, "win the
game" does not imply ending Agora. I considered whether R2419 had the power to
end Agora because it provides an alternate and much clearer basis for judging
FALSE, but I believe the CFJ is resolved without reaching this issue.

Agoran tradition is that there are many winners and gameplay continues after
winners are declared. Agoran rules on continuity of the game like R1698
strongly support this tradition. Past judgments (e.g. CFJ 2987) also support
this contention. Also, the last time "winning the game" was more explicitly
defined in the rules, it was not defined to not end play of Agora, and there
is no evidence that the new game-winning rules were intended (or must be read)
to change this custom.

The context of R2419 provides additional evidence for this non-destructive
mode of "winning". R2419's "reset scores to 0" procedure clearly does not
envision an Agora-destroying interpretation. In addition, even if it were
still close call, we can reasonably prefer an interpretation that R2419 that
can be effective at its Power over one which would require it to have a higher
Power.

(b) whether, if R2419 clearly called for ending Agora, this would be barred by
R1698 since the game would not exist to be ossified.

This, I believe, is a mistake in reading R1698. R1698 defines the term "Agora
is ossified"; it does not general define what it means for a nomic to be
ossified. Under R1698's definition, something can "cause Agora to become
ossified" even when Agora does not exist. Since R1698 also replaces the
offending gamestate change rather than resetting it after the fact, that R1698
might be destroyed by some gamestate change does not render R1698 ineffective
against that change.

(c) the wisdom of evaluating the "best interests of the game" when the game
might not exist.

Rule 217's first paragraph is usually thought of as describing what judges
should do, and therefore being something that is obeyed at the time of a
judgment. But, it often makes much more sense to view its command that "[the
text] be augmented by game custom, ..." as modifying what other rules mean
much like a definition. Thus, under R217, when interpreting an action in the
past, one should consider the "best interest of the game" at the time of the
action. In this case, the action is comex's purported win, and there clearly
was a game at that time to consider the "best interest" of.
