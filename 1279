Caller's Arguments:

This assumes that the Assessor has announced the results of the voting
on Proposal 4111, which is the subject of a previous CFJ.  If that CFJ
is FALSE, then this one is trivially FALSE as well.  If that CFJ is
true, though, then Proposal 4111 has created a Rule that does two
things:

  (a) Requires the Assessor to announce ASAP that an Ordinary Proposal
      has failed quorum.  This clause's trigger (Proposal 4112 fails
      quorum) occurred before Proposal 4111 took effect.  The Assessor
      probably wasn't required by this Rule to announce the failing of
      quorum (though Rule 208 establishes a similar requirement).

  (b) Makes the Proposal Democratic when such an announcement is made.
      This clause's trigger (Assessor announces that Proposal 4112
      failed quorum) occurred after Proposal 4111 took effect.  The
      Assessor's announcement probably triggered this clause and made
      Proposal 4112 Democratic.

      Note that, if an announcement is "such an announcement" only if
      the Rule in question required the Assessor to make it, then this
      may be FALSE.

Judge pTang's Arguments:

The "such an announcement" is sufficient in my judgement.  There was no
"such announcement" for P4112.

========================================================================

Judge Ziggy's Arguments:

First, I'll note that I do not believe that t's summary switcheroo matters.
Rule 376 reads:

      A Proposal which is Adopted takes effect at the time date-
      stamped on the first message sent by the Assessor to reach
      the Public Forum announcing the results of the voting on that
      Proposal.

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of
      the voting on a Proposal also contains the results of voting
      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in the order in which they were distributed.

The second paragraph is somewhat vague.  It seems like it applies to all
Proposals, not just adopted Proposals; I am interpreting it to mean that it
does not matter in what order *any* voting result announcements are in a
message, not just Adoption announcements.  Because of this, I believe that
anything in t's message dealing with Proposal 4111 "took effect" before
anything in the message dealing with Proposal 4112, and so the real
question is not about timing but about the existence of an announcement.

Having dismissed Steve's point 3, I turn to eir point 1.  Rule 1965 reads:

      As soon as possible after an Ordinary Proposal fails quorum, the
      Assessor shall announce that it has done so.  Upon such an
      announcement, the Proposal becomes Democratic, its Voting period
      is extended to end seven days after the announcement, and all
      Votes previously cast on it are cancelled.

It seems to me (and reading other parts of the Ruleset using "such" doesn't
change this) that the "such an announcement" just means any announcement by
the Assessor that an Ordinary Proposal has failed quorum.  4112 failed
quorum at the end of its Voting Period, which was before t announced 4111's
Adoption, so I do not believe that t was *required* to make the
announcement for 4112.  However, since e did, the Proposal did indeed
become Democratic.  I thus enter a verdict of TRUE for this CFJ.
