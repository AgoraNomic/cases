Caller's Arguments:

I suggest that the selected judge might wish to transfer
jurisdiction to CFJ 1514-1515 Judge Sir Toby [R2025].

Immediately before attempting to increase eir VP by 41, Murphy
attempted to increase eir VP by 1:

> I increase my Voting Potential by 1.  There is a fee for this
> action.

It is possible (the subject of CFJ 1514-1515) that the fee exists
but the amount is undefined, thus leaving Murphy's with undefined
kudos after eir increase of VP of 1.  If so, it may not be possible
to determine eir kudos when e attempted to raise eir VP by 41, thus
triggering the following paragraph of R1941 after my challenge:

  "If the Actor in fact possessed insufficient honor, or the
   honor of the Actor cannot be determined by reasonable
   effort, the action shall be deemed to have not occurred..."

So this CFJ determines to a certain extent the outcome of
the challenge.  (That isn't the direct subject of this CFJ
because if CFJ 1514-1515 finds that there is no defined fee,
then Murphy's statement "there is a fee for this action" isn't
true and my challenge never occurred!)

Judge Elysion's Arguments:

* Judicial finding 1: Political Charge has no meaning under the rules other
than the literal common language meaning of its constituent words.

All definitions of "Political Charge" have been removed from the ruleset.
(2052(b) refers to it, but does not define it.) Rule 1586 thus indicates
that it ceases to exist. Rule 754(4) further requires that the phrase be
interpreted by its everyday meaning; however, the phrase itself has no
special everyday meaning beyond its constituent words. (Compare to "rat
race", which has a meaning other than "a race where rats compete".)


* Judicial finding 2: 2052(b) does not define a "fee-based action" as
described by rule 1941

The first paragraph of rule 1941 specifically requires that a fee-based
action specify a "non-negative" cost (though not necessarily integral).
Based on 754(5), "non-negative" implies the existence of a zero element and
an ordering. The common language meaning of "Political Charge" does not
reasonably admit any such element or ordering. Thus, the procedure described
in 2052(b) is not a "fee-based action" as defined by the rules.


* Judicial finding 3: raising voting potential via 2052(b) is permitted but
impossible

Rule 2052(b) defines a process for raising voting potential, and thus
regulates it. (Although there is no rule specifically to this effect, there
is a strong game custom that the "converse" of rule 101 holds: actions
regulated by the rules are permitted to the extent the rules permit them.
Whether this is implicit in the nature of a game with rules is beyond the
scope of this discussion.)

However, the procedure described by 2052(b) is not possible.

Since 2052(b) is not describing a fee-based action, the common language
interpretation applies. This is more or less the definition in 1941. Some
pseudo-code may be helpful:

if (player->paid_fee == true && fee->amount == N * Political_Charge)
        player->voting_potential += N

However, by rule 2047 kudos are measured in integer units. (Or possibly real
units -- the question of rational or irrational amounts is not specifically
addressed.) Political Charge is neither a number nor associated with any
numeric quantity, and thus N times the Political Charge is not numeric -- or
even well-defined.

A real-life analogy is receiving a bill for sqrt(-1) dollars. Clearly such a
bill is not payable by any ordinary definition of currency and payment.

Thus, Murphy attempted to perform a permitted but impossible action. Both
attempts failed, and we can therefore determine that eir Honor is
unchanged.

Thus I judge as follows:

1514: FALSE
1515: FALSE
1516: FALSE
