Caller's Arguments:

These NoV are valid; they are NoVs 59 and 60, respectively. I contest
them and initiate criminal CFJs from them; I suggest maximal penalties
as almost every one of the statements constitutes an individual
violation and is separately punishable.

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

I contest both of these as the disclaimer clearly stated that some of
the actions might fail.

========================================================================

Judge Yally's Arguments:

In order to be guilty, Rule 1504 requires that:

       (c) judgement has not already been reached in another criminal
           case, or punishment already applied through another
           uncontested notice of violation, with the same Accused, the
           same rule, and substantially the same alleged act;

However, judgement has already been reached in CFJ 2830, with omd the
accused, Rule 2215 the breached rule, and basically the same act
(annoying the Herald). Thus, I judge omd NOT GUILTY.
