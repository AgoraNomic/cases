Judge secretsnail's Arguments:

The question essentially being asked here is if a player can act on behalf
of another player to make a pledge. The relevant rule text here is:

      A person CANNOT act
      on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
      action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
      person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
      might be taken within a message, including actions that would
      otherwise be taken by publishing certain text.

"Game action" is not defined by the rules of Agora, so it simply means
"action pertaining to the game" (CFJ 2882). Making a pledge certainly
pertains to the game as certain pledges must be tracked and followed. So
that leaves the next "CANNOT"; was the cashing of a promise an attempt to
act on behalf of another person to send a message?

When a player cashes a promise, "e acts on the creator of the promise's
behalf, causing the creator to act as if e published the promise's text".
When a player publishes text, e takes the actions mentioned in those texts,
that is, e acts as if e published the promise's text (because e did). E
does not, however, send a message by publishing text, as publishing is to
"send a public message whose body contains that thing". The sending of the
message is publishing, not an act that's a result of publishing. If sending
the message were to somehow be something the promise attempted to act on
behalf for, then all promises would fail. So it seems reasonable that
promises do not attempt to send messages, only take actions "that would
otherwise be taken by publishing certain text". As pledging is certainly
something a player can do by publishing certain text (sending a message
with a clear public pledge in it is exactly that), pledging CAN be done on
behalf of another player, provided all other conditions are met.

The individual possible pledges are each quite clear, not even containing
conditionals. The cashing of the promise was done within a public message,
so the pledge was public. The action was consented to by Madrid, as it was
taken as a part of a promise e created. Therefore, Madrid made the clear
public pledge "I shall transfer to someone 2 coins between now and a month
from now" as secretsnail, the bearer, had no degrees. Accordingly, I judge
CFJ 3953 TRUE.
