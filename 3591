Caller's Arguments:

On 27-Sept-17, I resolved a Victory Election:
https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-official/2017-September/011840.html

I was the winner of the election, so by R2482 I won the game.  There
were no debates or CoEs and the 27-Sept message has self-ratified.

Then on 23-Oct-17, I sent a message purporting to resolve the decision
(a second time):
https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/2017-October/036565.html

I immediately called a CFJ, but the CFJ was specifically on *whether I
won the game*:
https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/2017-October/036564.html

Importantly, the CFJ was *not* on whether the decision existed and was
resolved as indicated.  Our past precedents are pretty clear that CFJs
and CoEs have to be very specific to raise Doubts that stop self-
ratification, and this CFJ was on one *consequence* of the Decision, not
the decision itself, so I believe the self-ratification wasn't stopped
by this CFJ.

So I think, on 30-Oct, that the 23-October resolution message self-
ratified the decision as existing and being "resolved as indicated".

But this raises an interesting question.  It *may* have ratified a "new"
resolution of the decision (which would make it TRUE that I won again). 
Or it *may* have failed to resolve the decision, while at the same time
starting a self-ratifying clock for a fact that we already knew, that
the decision existed and was resolved as indicated on 27-Sept (leading
to a FALSE).

I personally think that the date stamp of the message is part of what is
indicated in "resolved as indicated" so I favor TRUE (naturally).  But
I also wonder what implications TRUE/FALSE have for future decisions
that have multiple resolution attempts. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Publius Scribonius Scholasticus's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 3591 FALSE because Rule 208 reads "The vote collector for an
unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve it by announcement, indicating
the outcome." Given that the decision was not unresolved, G. could not
resolve the election. According to Rule 2043, the purported resolution
ratified, the decision's existence and outcome. However per Rule 208,
gamestate changing effects occur at the resolution of the decision and
the decision had been resolved, so the gamestate had already changed.
Rule 2043 does not provide that the resolution date ratifies or that
effects ratify, therefore the document purported ratification, but was
not a ratification and therefore the facts ratify, but no further
effects occurred.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Alexis's Arguments:

To repeat the background, G. resolved a Victory Election on September 27,
clearly leading to em winning the game. E purported to resolve the decision
a second time, on October 23, but this failed because a decision, once
resolved, cannot be resolved a second time. However, Rule 2034 provides:

A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision constitutes
self-ratifying claims that
  1. such a decision existed,
  2. it was resolved as indicated, and
  3. (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a proposal
existed, was adopted, and took effect.

Thus, G's message of October 23 constitutes the listed self-ratifying
claims. Claim 1 is not in dispute, as the decision definitely existed.
Claim 3 is also not in dispute, since the indicated outcome was not to
adopt a proposal. Thus, the question before the Court is whether the
self-ratification of claim 2 is strong enough to result in a second win for
G.

There is no indication of what "resolved as indicated" means. There are
several reasonable interpretations. For instance, it could include
ratifying the existence of votes, or it could not (this would be relevant
if a later conditional was dependent on votes, for instance). In
particular, Rule 2034 is silent about when the resolution of the decision
occurs. It is thus silent about whether ratifying claim 2 for an
already-resolved decision causes that decision to be resolved again. As was
discussed on the lists, there is an argument that "resolved as indicated"
should include the time of resolution. In that case, the ratification would
have to ratify the time of resolution, meaning that either the first
resolution is ratified away, or the decision is resolved a second time.

Given that the rules are silent, let us look at game custom. It is often
the case that, if a proposal is resolved incorrectly, the Assessor
publishes a revised copy of the entire resolution message, rather than just
a resolution of the incorrectly-resolved proposal. The revised copy is,
consequently, a public message purporting to resolve the Agoran decisions
to adopt all proposals in the batch, rather than just revising them. Yet
there has never been a suggestion that this results in a proposal being
adopted a second time by way of ratification. The custom here is clear;
claims 2 and 3 combined do not result in the re-resolution of a proposal,
which means claim 2 alone certainly does not. Overturning this custom would
have a devastating effect on the ruleset as it would mean many proposals
took effect multiple times.

Given that the text of the rules here is highly vague, it is reasonable to
exclude any mention of time from the ratification, except insofar that when
an incorrectly-resolved decision is ratified, then the decision is ratified
as having been resolved at the time of the purported resolution's
publication (this interpretation, too, is governed by custom).

Both proposals and victory elections rely on essentially the same wording
for triggering the result of a resolution. Compare Rule 2482 (since
repealed) "Upon the resolution of the decision, if the outcome is a person,
then that person wins the game." to Rule 106 "When a decision about whether
to adopt a proposal is resolved, ... it takes effect."

As a result, there is no reasonable interpretation where victory elections
behave differently from proposals with regards to ratification. As a
result, we must conclude that the second decision ratifying does not cause
the decision to be resolved a second time and, consequently, G. did not win
the game as a result. The CFJ is thus FALSE.
