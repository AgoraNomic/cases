With Agoran Consent, I do so (using the intent where the text does not
contain quote marks and with "decided"). Falsifian and Jason supported;
there were no objections. Disclaimer: this may fail if the correct
wording is "devised" rather than "decided"; see the CFJ below.

I believe I'm not required to resolve the intents that contain a
formatting mistake, even though they have the required support, because
the text is incorrect and thus I neither CAN nor SHALL resolve them –
the procedure for creating those intents was not followed correctly.

The intent without the formatting mistake, but with "devised", does not
currently have Agoran Consent.


Caller's Arguments: 

Rule 2655(c) requires me to replace each instance of a
chosen noun with "Device", "(including grammatical variations, e.g.
replacing "<noun>'s" with "Device's")". Does "decided" count as a
grammatical variation of "decision" for this purpose? If so, is the
corresponding grammatical variation of "device" "devised"? I think that
a parallel exists: a decision is something that has been decided, and a
device is something that has been devised (and etymologically,
"decision" and "decided" have the same root word, Latin "decidere").

If "decided" does count as a variation of "decision", then the rule
amendment failed because I didn't replace every word that I should
have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge R. Lee's Arguments:

Rule 2665 reads as follows
' c) Select exactly one noun from the selected text, and replace

      each instance of that noun with "Device" (including grammatical
      variations, e.g. replacing "<noun>'s" with "Device's").'

This rule requires the Keeper of the Device to replace all instances
of a certain noun. The explanatory parenthetical notes that variations
of that noun must also be replaced. However the text outside the
explanatory/definitional parenthetical makes clear that only nouns can
be replaced and nowhere gives the power to replace adjectives or
verbs. Generally speaking, explanations or definitions don't
completely expand and replace the main text of the Rule. \

This interpretation is also supported by the best interests of the
game. The word 'device' has a clear plural form but it doesn't really
have a verb form. 'Devise' and 'device' are not listed as grammatical
forms of the same word in any dictionary. Furthermore, the adjectival
form of device is listed in some but not all online dictionaries as
being 'deviceful'.

Therefore the procedure at issue here which didn't change the word
'decided' succeeded. CFJ 3939 is TRUE.
