Judgement 48 (Ronald)  Mon, 04 Oct 93 12:04:40 MET

"As the Rules 384, 385, 394, 408, 410, 425, 426, 427 and 452
all take precedence over Rule 453, any penalty inflicted on the
Speaker as a consequence of a violation of one these Rules shall
be applied in the current Game.

Notably, the ten Point penalty incurred by the Speaker by his Appeal
on CFJ 36, for which Judgment was SUSTAINED should be assessed
in the Current Game."
[Motivation: 453 is both illogical and inconsistent with preceding Rules.]
