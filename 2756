==============================  CFJ 2756  ==============================

    Voting limits on an Agoran decision are measured when it is
    resolved, rather than when its voting period ends.

Judge omd's Arguments:

TRUE per CFJ 1675.  Although the rule in question is no longer worded
as a set of instructions, it is still vague as to when the outcome is
decided and the precedent ought to hold.  Also, the following text:

          In case of a tie, the vote collector SHALL select one of the
          leaders as the outcome.

(which may or may not be broken due to MMI) implies that the outcome
can change after the voting period is over.
