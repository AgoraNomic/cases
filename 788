======================================================================

Statement:

The Assessor's Report of July 1 is in error, in that Chuck
has 94 Extra Votes, and TAL has -80 Extra Votes; and the
Scorekeepor's Report of July 5 is in error, in that
a transfer of at least 189 points from TAL to Chuck was
not recorded.

======================================================================

Arguments:

These errors are due to two transfers required by the Currency
Scam Contest, of 80 EVs and at least 189 points.  (The point transfer
stated in the Contest regulation calls for 199.5 points to be
transferred.  90% of the points necessary for me to win at that
time, however, was 189 points.  A case can be made that 199.5
points were transferred anyway.  Since I do not wish to address
this issue here, I merely state "at least 189 points" were
transferred.

The question of whether these transfers took place hinges on whether
or not they were "involuntary" transfers.  Player's treasuries
may "go negative" due to an involuntary transfer, but not due
to a voluntary transfer.  So if these transfers were involuntary,
they took place; if they were not, they did not.

Rule 1472 states, in part,

      Transfers which are not voluntary transfers ("involuntary"
      transfers) may only be made as specifically required by the
      Rules.

These transfers were clearly not voluntary transfers, as they
do not meet the requirements in the first paragraph of Rule 1472
(i.e. they attempted to transfer more points and EVs than TAL had).
Thus, either they are involuntary transfers or they were not transfers
at all.  I would like to address three objections which have been
raised to the proposition that the transfers were involuntary.

1.  It has been alleged that the transfers were not required by
the Rules.  This is clearly not so; Rule 1446 requires Contestants
to obey Contest Regulations; thus, a transfer required by
Contest Regulations is also required by Rule 1446.  Contest
Regulations have no authority in and of themselves; they
have only that authority granted them by the Rules.  In fact,
anything which is required of Players *must* be required by
the Rules, as nothing else has, in and of itself, the legal
authority to require obedience.

2.  It has been alleged that any transfers taking place directly
due to Player actions are voluntary transfers.  There is nothing
in Rule 1472 to suggest this.  True, 1472 does define voluntary
transfers as taking place upon the action of a Player, but there
is *nothing* to suggest that all point changes directly due to
Players' actions must be voluntary.

3.  It has been alleged that the transfers are required by the Rules,
but not *specifically* required by the Rules.  The American Heritage
Dictionary, 2nd ed., lists "specifically" as an adverb form of
"specific."  "Specific" is defined as "explicitly set forth; definite."
The second of these is easier to demonstrate: the transfers required
are very definite, being 80 Extra Votes and 199.5 points from
TAL to me.  Are they explicitly set forth?  Yes, Rule 1446
explicitly states that Contestants must follow contest Regulations.

Thus, I conclude that the transfers in question are specifically
required by the Rules and are thus involuntary transfers.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgement: FALSE

Aguments:

I'll address the Caller's points in order:

# 1.  It has been alleged that the transfers were not required by
# the Rules.  This is clearly not so; Rule 1446 requires Contestants
# to obey Contest Regulations; thus, a transfer required by
# Contest Regulations is also required by Rule 1446.  Contest
# Regulations have no authority in and of themselves; they
# have only that authority granted them by the Rules.  In fact,
# anything which is required of Players *must* be required by
# the Rules, as nothing else has, in and of itself, the legal
# authority to require obedience.

It is true that any Contest Regulation has force only through the
authority of 1446, and thus falls on the precedence scale along with
1446.  (Note this fact.)

# 2.  It has been alleged that any transfers taking place directly
# due to Player actions are voluntary transfers.  There is nothing
# in Rule 1472 to suggest this.  True, 1472 does define voluntary
# transfers as taking place upon the action of a Player, but there
# is *nothing* to suggest that all point changes directly due to
# Players' actions must be voluntary.

This is true.  There is nothing in 1472 to suggest that a Player cannot
trigger an involuntary transfer by an act of free will.  I willingly
took on the office of Herald, does that make my salary a voluntary
transfer?

# 3.  It has been alleged that the transfers are required by the Rules,
# but not *specifically* required by the Rules.  The American Heritage
# Dictionary, 2nd ed., lists "specifically" as an adverb form of
# "specific."  "Specific" is defined as "explicitly set forth; definite."

# TAL to me.  Are they explicitly set forth?  Yes, Rule 1446
# explicitly states that Contestants must follow contest Regulations.

This, in fact, was my first argument against this scam.  My reading
at first led me to the conclusion that this language-- "specifically
required by the Rules" -- meant that this only applied to clauses
within *Rules* that award/penalize some explicit amount of currency.

However, the Caller's argument sways me a considerable distance because
the only rational way to adjudicate any Contest Regulation's
relationship to the Ruleset as a whole, is through its enabling
legislation, 1446. The Contest Regulations can be considered, in effect,
an invisible part of Rule 1446, only applicable to the Contestmaster and
Contestant.

I am swayed the rest of the way by the following fact:

             Rule 1446 takes precedence over 1472!

In a bizarre oversight, 1472 does not claim precedence over any
other Rule, Ordinance, anything, that claims to proscribe a Currency
transfer.

In effect, it does not matter what the language of 1472 has to say
about voluntary and involuntary transfers, negative and non-negative
totals-- it defers to the Contest Rule!

Those who are frightened by the prospect may cling to the following
clause in 1446:

   "All Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
    except where these conflict with the Rules."

This doesn't solve the problem because the Regulation:

   "4.  Within 72 hours after becoming a Contestant, TAL shall transfer
        80 Extra Votes and 199.5 Points from TAL's Treasury to Chuck's
        Treasury. TAL shall be responsible for reporting these transfers
        to the appropriate Officers.  After these transfers take place
        and the transfers are reported, this Contest shall be dissolved.
        A Contestant ceases to be a Contestant when this Contest is
        dissolved."

Doesn't conflict with the Rules.  Rule 1446 absolves Contestant and
Contestmaster from following Regulations that Conflict with the Rules--
it does not absolve them from being forced to act in a way that conflict
with the Rules. If there was a conflict, it was in TAL's attempt to
comply, *not* in the Regulation.  And, as stated beforehand, that
conflict (if it existed at all) is resolved by 1472's deference to 1446.

The only remaining consideration is who was legally responsible to
report TAL's transfer.  TAL was the Player who did the Reporting, but
according to 1446:

     "[The Contestmaster] reports all currency transfers taking place
      under the Regulations, is the Executor of the Contest Fund, and
      maintains the Regulations."

In applying my interpretation of the contest Regs as extension of 1446,
we have a situation where the Rule explicitly contradicts itself,
saying in one place that Chuck (who did no reporting) should report the
transfer, and in another that TAL (who did report) should be the Player
to Report the transfer.

However, one clause is within the Rule itself and the other in its
subordinate Regulations. Since there is a conflict, I must give the actual
Rule greater weight than the Regulations it enables.
Rule 1446 MUST take precedence over the Regulations it empowers,
or else it could not empower them at all--
it would have no power to bind them or define their characteristics.

It was Chuck's duty, as Contestmaster, to report the transfer, despite
the language of Reg 5. The transfer has not yet been reported.

Does that invalidate the transfer?

As to *that* question, rule 1472 claims to cancel any unreported
Currency transfer after the passage of a week.  But, as I've pointed
out, almost every Rule takes precedence over 1472, including 1446.  1472
doesn't have the power to invalidate TAL's transfer no matter how long
it takes Chuck to report it.

1472 also claims that a transfer cannot occur before it is reported.  This
explicitly conflicts with the language of Reg 5, which specifies:
"Within 72 hours after becoming a Contestant."  Since 1446 takes
precedence, the transfer had to have taken place at that time, no mater
who did or did not report it.

So even if Chuck did not report the transfer, because of the wording of
Reg 5, the transfer occurred.  Presumably this happened 72 hours after
TAL became a Contestant.  This would be sometime during the evening of
Sun, July 2.

However, the documents alleged to be in error were dated the day before
this transfer occurred, so I must rule the specific Statement FALSE.

      There is a type of Directive, called a Currency Directive.
      These Directives have an Adoption Index of 2. If adopted, they
      have the effect of specifying the Currency holdings contained
      in an Entity or Entities' Treasury or Treasuries. They may have

======2. Rule 1472

Rule 1472/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Transfer of Currencies

      The owner of a given Treasury may, at any time, transfer
      any or all of the units of Currency within that Treasury to any
      other Treasury, so long as this transfer is permitted by the
      Rules.  Such a transfer is known as a "voluntary" transfer.
      Voluntary transfers are restricted to positive quantities, and
      in no case may more of a given Currency be transferred from a
      Treasury than that Treasury possessed prior to the transfer.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency must be notified as soon as
      possible by the owner of the Treasury from which a
      voluntary transfer is made.  If a voluntary transfer is not
      reported to the Recordkeepor within seven days, it is cancelled
      and does not take place.  

      Transfers which are not voluntary transfers ("involuntary"
      transfers) may only be made as specifically required by the
      Rules.  Such transfers must be reported to the Recordkeepors of
      the Currencies involved as soon as possible thereafter, by a
      Player specified by the Rules.  Involuntary transfers may be of
      any amount (limited only by MUQ rounding), and may involve
      amounts greater than the amount in the Treasury from which the
      transfer originates.

      If an involuntary transfer is not reported to the Recordkeepor
      within seven days, or there is no Rule which requires a Player
      to report the involuntary transfer, the transfer is cancelled
      and does not take place.

      All transfers take effect no sooner than the time the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency is informed of the transfer.

80 Extra Votes and 199.5 Points from TAL's Treasury to Chuck's Treasury.
TAL shall be responsible for reporting these transfers to the

transfers are reported, this Contest shall be dissolved.  A Contestant

To: nomic-business@teleport.com


The Currency Scam Contest Regulations require me to transfer
80 Extra Votes and 199.5 Points from my Treasury to Chuck's Treasury.
(I should have read the small-print first, I guess  :-)

However, as I emptied carefully my Treasury just a minute ago, one
might think that there is a problem.

Luckily the Rule 1472 ("Transfer of Currencies") provides a solution.
Note that both these transfers are "involuntary" transfers in the
sense of Rule 1472. Both are specifically required by the Contest
Rule, which obliges me to obey the Regulations.

Note also, that "involuntary" transfers may result in a Player ending up
with a negative number of a certain Currency.

Therefore:
Mir. Assessor, please take note that I transfer 80 Extra Votes from my
Treasury to Chuck's Treasury, an "involuntary" transfer required by the
Currency Scam Contest Regulations.

Mir. Scorekeepor, please take note that I transfer 199.5 Points from my
Treasury to Chuck's Treasury, an "involuntary" transfer required by the
Currency Scam Contest Regulations.

As these transfers have now been reported, the CS Contest shall be
dissolved and I cease to be a Contestant.

Who can guess, what the next step will be in this Scam?

Special note:

TAL's 80 EV transfer to Chuck is invalidated as in excess of his
EV holdings, under Rule 1472.  TAL's claim that the transfer is
"involuntary" is rejected, since Rule 1466's requirement that TAL 
obey the Contest Regs is phrased generally and not "specifically"
with respect to this kind of transfer.

An "involuntary" transfer must be an automatic one which takes 
place without any action on the player's part, and there is no Rule
enabling Contest Regulations to cause such a transfer (except as 
detailed in Rule 1466, when a contest dissolves).

      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      currency transfers taking place under the Regulations, is the
      Executor of the Contest Fund, and maintains the Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is a Treasury, as provided for in other Rules.
      The owner of this Treasury is the Contest, and the Executor of
      this Treasury is, at all times, the Contestmaster of the
      Contest.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        1. how a Contestmaster is replaced. However, no person may
           become Contestmaster without eir consent;
        2. how the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent, so
           long as this does not conflict with the Rules;
        3. the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units one or more Currency;
        4. additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants, 
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants;
        5. how the Regulations may be changed.  If they do not so 
           specify, the Regulations may not be changed. Whenever the 
           Regulations are changed, the Contestmaster must post the 
           new Regulations to the Public Forum, and no such change is
           effective until it is so posted;
        and
        6. how the Contest may be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.  A
      Contestmaster may resign at any time by posting a message to
      that effect to the Public Forum, at which time e ceases to be
      Contestmaster.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or upon unanimous agreement of the
      Contestmaster and all Contestants, or as otherwise provided in
      the rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants. 

      If the Contest Regulations require a transfer to be made, but
      the Contest Fund has insufficient currencies to permit that
      transfer to be made, sufficient currencies to cover the transfer
      shall be involuntarily transferred from the Contestmaster's
      Treasury to the Contest Fund.  The Contestmaster shall report
      this transfer to the appropriate Recordkeepors.

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

(in case Ian did not forward this, I'm providing it to you)

As Kelly suggested, I have examined my records for a notification 
from Chuck as to a transfer of EV's under the Regulations of the
Currency Scam Contest.  Chuck did not report such a transfer.

Chuck did report a Reform Coin transfer to me in my role as Reform 
Vizier. This has nothing to do with EV's, but I'm including it so
that you can see for yourself.

He also made a COE after the Assessor's Report of July 1.  After
careful examination, I find that his COE also does not contain a report
of a transfer, but simply claims that the reported number of EV's for 
Chuck and TAL is wrong.

I claim that this Assessor's report is in error, in that Chuck
should have 94 Extra Votes and TAL should have -80.

First, I believe the transfer *is* specifically required by the
Rules.  After all, a 79-EV transfer would not have satisfied
Rule 1446.  How much more specific can you get?

The allegation that the transfer was involuntary because it
required action of TAL is also invalid.   There is nothing in
Rule 1472 that states or implies that a transfer dependent on
the action of a Player is automatically voluntary.  (True, it
describes voluntary transfers, which are dependent on the
action of a Player, but it does *not* say that all transfers
dependent on a Player's action are voluntary.)

If we were to follow this argument, the two point loss when
declining to serve as Judgement would also be a voluntary
transfer, as it takes place only upon the action of the Player!
