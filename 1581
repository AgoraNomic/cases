Caller's Arguments:

By the first paragraph of Rule 1933/10 (and Rule 2040/4), the chamber
of a proposal defaults to democratic if its adoption index is at least
2, ordinary otherwise.  The proposal in question originally had an
adoption index of 1, which was changed to 3 in a later message, as
permitted by rule 1483/12.  What does this imply regarding the chamber
of the proposal?

There are two possibilities.  First, that the "default" value is
simply a value selected for the proposal at the time of submission
in the absence of any other indicated value.  Under this
interpretation, the proposal would still be ordinary, as nothing
would have acted to modify its chamber.

The second possibility is that the "default" is the value that is
carried when no other value has been set.  In this case, the proposal
would now be democratic as well as AI-3, since the proposal's chamber
has not yet been explicitly set.

Rule 1933/10 (Power=2)
A Proposal's Chamber

      Chamber is a stuck proposal switch with values ordinary and
      democratic.  The default chamber for a proposal with an adoption
      index of at least 2 is democratic.

      An ordinary proposal with an adoption index of two or greater is
      stalled.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a stalled
      proposal is undistributable, and if a proposal is distributed
      that was stalled at the time of distribution, its chamber shall
      immediately and automatically be set to democratic.


Rule 1483/12 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
      including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
      other explicit changes to the gamestate.

      A legislator submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal.  As soon as
      possible afterward, the Promotor shall add this proposal to the
      Proposal Pool.

      Before the Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may
      modify its adoption index by announcement.  The default adoption
      index of a proposal is one.

      All players are legislators.


Rule 2040/4 (Power=2)
Switches

      A switch is a set of states associated with a class of entities.
      Each switch shall have a default state, which if not otherwise
      specified shall be the first state mentioned in the rule
      defining the switch.

      The recordkeepor for a class of entities shall also maintain
      records of any switches associated with that class, as well as
      the current state of the switch for each entity of the class.
      If the recordkeepor is required to publish a report, that report
      shall include records of these switches.  The rules may require
      a different player to maintain and report these records.

      Whenever an entity is created in a class of entities associated
      with a switch, it shall be in the state of the switch specified
      by the order or provision creating it; if no state is specified,
      it shall be in the default state of the switch.

      Whenever an entity joins a class of entities associated with a
      switch, the entity shall be in the default state of the switch.

      Whenever an instrument indicates that a switch on an entity is
      set or changed to some state, and the rules do not otherwise
      forbid it, the entity shall come to be in that state and
      simultaneously cease to be in any other state of the switch.

      A player who may flip a switch on an entity to some state other
      than the current state of the switch may do so by announcement.
      In eir announcement, e must indicate the entity, switch, and new
      state.  Upon this announcement, provided it is valid, the switch
      is set to the named state.

      A switch is loose unless the rules define it as stuck.

      An executor of an entity may flip any of the loose switches on
      that entity, unless the rules otherwise prohibit doing so.

      The stuck switches on an entity can be flipped only when the
      rules so indicate.

      Whenever a switch is created, or becomes associated with a class
      of entities, then each entity in the class that had previously
      been in a state that is now a state of the switch shall continue
      to be in that state; all other entities in the class shall be in
      the default state of the switch.

      Whenever a state ceases to be a state of a switch, all entities
      in the class that had previously been in that state shall be in
      the default state of the switch.

Judge G.'s Arguments:

I am swayed by Maud's argument that one switch exists for the "Proposal" class
of entities, but it behaves differently for different subclasses.  R2040
states that a switch by definition has one default, but R1933 states that the
Chamber switch has two defaults (One for each subclass of AI<2 and AI>=2
Proposals). R1933 has precedence over R2040 (R1482), so Chamber has two
default states.

When a Proposal is submitted it has a default AI of 1 (R1483), and the Chamber
is set to the default for that subclass (R2040), which is Ordinary (R1933).
But as subsequent events change the AI, they do not automatically change the
Chamber to the default for the new subclass.

Further, by Rule 1483p2, it is clear that a body of text becomes a Proposal by
publication.  (R1483p2 speaks of intent to "become" a proposal, implying that
the proposal is not a proposal until publication).  And the instant it becomes
a Proposal, its AI defaults to 1 (R1483p3).

It is not possible to perform actions on a proposal before it exists, so by
necessity, ANY attempt to change AI by announcement (e.g., R1843p3) must occur
*after* the proposal is published.

So the typical sentence "I submit the following Proposal and request an AI of
2", to be effective, must be construed as two sequential actions (R1527).
Therefore, such a statement has the effect of first submitting the Proposal
(which gains a default AI of 1 and a default Chamber of Ordinary), and then
immediately after changing the AI to 2.  But this does not change the Chamber.

(Aside:  The convenience of placing the body of the proposal after the whole
sentence does not change the sequence, the first action is "to submit the
following proposal" and the phrase "following proposal" contains enough
context to substitute the body of the proposal as being the first action,
provided the body is in the same message as the submission statement).

So some recent proposals have been distributed while stalled. While they were
switched to democratic when distributed (R1933p2) and therefore their results
stand, their distribution was, in fact, in (unknowing) violation of the rules.
