Judge Murphy's Arguments:

FALSE.  "Formal details" seems too vague; we could use a phrase to
encapsulate the concept that e.g. "between 4 and 14 days after time X"
is sufficiently specific, even if the choice of timing has some other
effects (e.g. occurring before or after some other event).  Also,
consider the hypothetical case where a player achieves a dictatorship
in non-obvious fashion and immediately uses it to apply a rule change
from a proposal that was due to be resolved as adopted anyway.
