==============================  CFJ 2319  ==============================

    'e' is primarily used in a mathematical context, and therefore means
    'approximately 2.718281828' when used in rules.

Caller's Arguments:

>From rule 754/8:
{{{
(3) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
    and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, by
    default has the meaning it has in those contexts.
}}}
The term isn't defined anywhere in the ruleset...

========================================================================

Judge omd's Arguments:

FALSE.  'e' is primarily used in mathematical contexts, so BY DEFAULT
it means '2.718281828', but most rules are not written such that this
is a reasonable interpretation-- it is quite difficult to make a
sentence where 'e' could be reasonably interpreted as the mathematical
constant.  We therefore choose the nondefault meaning 'he/she'.
Besides, the difference between 'e' and 'he/she' is a difference in
dialect or grammar and/or the use of a synonym in place of a word, all
of which are Rule 754 (1) inconsequential.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

Er, I meant to say where 'e' could be reasonably interpreted either as
the mathematical constant or as a pronoun.
