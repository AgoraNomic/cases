Caller's Evidence:

[CotC: The initiating message specified UTF-8. E280AE is Unicode
 RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE, E280AC is POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING. The
 numbering of these CFJs does not necessarily match the order in which
 they were created.]

Define the word "=E2=80=AEooF=E2=80=AC" as meaning {I call a CFJ on the
statement "I
have already called a CFJ in this message. (Foo)".}, and define the
word "=E2=80=AEraB=E2=80=AC" as meaning {I call a CFJ on the statement "I have
already
called a CFJ in this message. (Bar)".}.

=E2=80=AEraB ooF

The answers are obvious, right? The first one is FALSE, and the second
one is TRUE.

Oh, and for good measure, I call a CFJ on the statement "I have
already called a CFJ in this message. (Plaz)".

Judge FKA441344's Arguments:

The email's headers indicate that it should be interpreted as UTF-8,
and when it is so interpreted the Foo comes before the Bar.
