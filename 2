Call for Judgement from Ronald Kunne: (Fri 23 Jul 1993 10:25)

"A Voter who votes Against a proposal, but who hasn't submitted
any of the fifteen proposals before this proposal, is
acting against the spirit of the game"

I find this statement to be UNDECIDED. 

			 --------------------

Justification:

It is unreasonable to censure a player for failing to submit
proposals.  By voting against proposals they at least show an interest
in the game and fulfil a useful role. So while it is possible that
such a player is "acting against the spirit of the game", this would
clearly be impossible to determine.
