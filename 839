======================================================================

Reasons & arguments :

The statement is self-evident.


======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge

My judgement is TRUE.

Reasons: I cannot find any evidence that any such Virus Report was published by
Wes, and I cannot find any reason why Rule 1454 should not apply.

Question: Why was this CFJ'd? Was a COE tried, and if so, what was Wes's
response? Sorry if this has been discussed before; I don't recall it.

Evidence:

Rule 1454/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Virus

      There is a Nomic Entity called the Virus which has the effect
      of altering the texts of Rules, in the manner and under the
      conditions set out below. This process is known as "infection".
      The effect of the Virus on a Rule, when it has an effect, is
      that of a non-Proposed Amendment to that Rule. Thus, the Virus
      can only be effective inasmuch as it satisfies the Rules for
      the effectiveness of non-Proposed Rule Changes.

      The selection of the Rule to be infected by the Virus occurs as
      follows: as soon as possible after the beginning of each Nomic
      Week, the Rulekeepor shall select a random integer in the range
      [M,N], where M and N are, respectively, the numbers of the
      lowest and highest numbered Rules at the beginning of that
      week. Call a number selected in this way a Virus Number.  If
      the Virus Number selected is the number of a Rule, then that
      Rule is infected as described below, and no further Virus
      Numbers are selected in that week. If the Virus Number is not
      the number of a Rule, then a new Virus Number is selected as
      above, unless five such Virus Numbers (none of which is the
      number of a Rule) have already been selected in that week. In
      that case, the Virus is ineffective and no Rule is infected in
      that week. 

      The Rulekeepor shall publish the results of the selection
      process in the Public Forum within 24 hours of the completion
      of that process. If a Rule has been infected, e shall announce
      the number of that Rule. If no Rule has been infected, then e
      shall announce that no Rule has been infected.

      An infected Rule is amended in the following way, given that
      other Rules permit it: if the Rule does not already contain the
      sentence "This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not
      contain this sentence.", then that sentence is appended to the
      Rule. If the Rule already contains the sentence, then the
      sentence is deleted from the Rule.

      There is one exception to the above: if this Rule is the
      infected Rule, then this Rule automatically Repeals itself.
