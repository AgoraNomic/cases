I initiate a criminal case on this as that is irrelevant.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Machiavelli:

Reasonable belief is relevant here. See Rule 1504: "the Accused could
not have reasonably believed that the alleged act did not violate the
specified rule".

Also, I question whether violating a SHALL is a rule violation if
GUILTY is inappropriate.

Judge G.'s Arguments:

The FOLLOWING JUDICIAL DECLARATIONS, associated with CFJ 2864 judgement,
should cause the List of Succession to converge on a single state
(the same state as if such declarations were wholly ineffective).
Therefore, ANY JUDGE who claims beyond this that the List of Succsssion
positions are unknown (without further evidence) has NO EXCUSE FOR
LACK OF KNOWLEDGE in violating truthiness.

I make the following Judicial declarations as judge of CFJ 2864:
Due to the recent alleged judicial declarations,
        { omd's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { G.'s position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { coppro's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { Wooble's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { Tiger's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { Taral's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { ehird's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { Sgeo's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { Tanner L. Swett's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { ais523's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { woggle's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { Murphy's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }
        { Yally's position on the List of Succession is unknown. }

If the last one worked, this one works.  If it didn't, this didn't.
Either way, the list has converged.

Judgement for CFJ 2864

It's important to note that the Pariah Rule, 2312, ENCOURAGES truthful
NoVs to be brought against the Pariah, and ENCOURAGES penalties to
be enforced.  However, it clearly DOES NOT encourage a GUILTY verdict
in places where NOT GUILTY is appropriate.

In this case, for a non-Pariah, the appropriate sentence would be
GUILTY/DISCHARGE:  An Officer SHOULD know what eir report is supposed
to contain, so lack of knowledge is not a defense when the public
record for the report is easily researched.  However, trivial mistakes
are worthy of discharge.  (This should be compared to a report-error
based on a common misinterpretation, which would be NOT GUILTY as
reasonable research would not reveal it).

Still, I am encouraged to enforce penalties, not discharge.  However, I
am not (by the letter of R2312) encouraged to apply Rests, but simply
"enforce penalties".

Therefore, I judge Pariah Tanner L. Swett GUILTY and sentence em to
APOLOGY with the following prescribed words:
    Losing, Finalize, Serendipity, Happenstance, Focus,
    Perjury, Hottentot, Salient, Justice, Projector.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Machiavelli:

Citizens of Agora, it has become salient to me that, perhaps due to
losing my focus, I have apparently committed a sort of perjury by
publishing an incorrect Proposal Pool report. This is so lacking in
justice that maybe I might as well have published the report in
Hottentot. Since Agora has been unduly affected by this happenstance,
let me make it clear that I utterly hope my ability to publish correct
reports is yet to finalize. In addition, the room we played in last
night contained a projector, which is a fact of little serendipity.

Why did I ever think it was acceptable not to triple-check my reports
twice before sending them? Why did I ever take the office of Pariah?
How many apologies must I endure before I have learned my lesson? How
many questions are in this paragraph? How many can there be, without
the number being ridiculous? Will Agora ever come to forgive me? How
can I improve myself so that this will never happen again? Is there,
for all integers a, b, and c such that gcd(a,b,c) = 1, a pair of
integers x and y such that (ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 - y^2)^2 = 1? Am I still
a good person? Can I ever be?

My desire is that the answer to all of the above questions be "yes".
