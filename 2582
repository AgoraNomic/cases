Caller's Arguments:

Powerful Dances are, by definition, powerful, therefore must
have power, therefore must be instruments. (I suspect that no Powerful
Dances exist, though, rules-wise, so this is unlikely to be a problem.)

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Pavitra:

> Rule 1688/4 (Power=3)
> Power
>
>       The power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.
>       An instrument is an entity with positive power.

If this said instead "An entity that is not an instrument CANNOT have
positive power", then R2029 would simply take precedence over it by
higher power. As it is, I concur with the caller's arguments.

========================================================================

Judge Rodlen's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 2582 true.  A Powerful Dance has a separate and distinct
existence, and is therefore an entity.  Therefore, as it is powerful, it is an
Instrument.

========================================================================

Appellant G.'s Arguments:

I intend to call for appeal of this with 2 support.  We are requested
by R754 to defer to mathematical definitions, and a mathematical
definition of "powerful" is "leading to many or important deductions".
Therefore, a dance of this source is simply a decent interpretive dance
and not one possessing rules-defined Power.  This makes as much sense
as anything the judge said.

But I'll also note that as a power-4 rule, the Town Fountain specifically
does *not* defer (in R754 sense) to the lower- powered Rules definition
of "power".

========================================================================

Appellant Wooble's Arguments:

I support.  Even if we accept that the "power" in "powerful" is
rules-defined Power, in ordinary language "powerful" doesn't usually
mean "having power" in a generic sense but carries a connotation of
having a lot of power.  For example, you wouldn't call a 1 horsepower
engine "powerful" even though it has power. If a judge is going to
posit that "powerful" refers to Power, I'd like em to define a certain
threshold of Power below which an instrument is not Powerful.

========================================================================

Judge omd's Arguments:

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

...

      (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules by default has that
          meaning when used in any Rule of equal or lesser power, as
          do its ordinary-language synonyms not explicitly defined by
          the rules.

This cannot be applicable, as there is no other Power-4 rule that
could possibly define 'Powerful' or a synonym.

      (3) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, by
          default has the meaning it has in those contexts.

The word 'powerful' is not primarily used in mathematical or legal
contexts (I for one have never seen it used in either context), so
this doesn't apply either.

      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          by default has its ordinary-language meaning.

answers.com defines 'powerful' as follows:
1. Having or capable of exerting power.
2. Effective or potent: a powerful drug.

      In determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term,
      definitions contained in lower-powered Rules, followed by
      definitions used in contracts or other Agoran legal documents,
      SHOULD be used for guidance.

The definitions contained in lower-powered Rules clearly only have
influence on the ordinary-language meaning of a term insofar as the
term is applied to Rule-defined entities.  If a Dance were a Rule, a
Powerful Dance would be a Rule capable of greatly influencing the
game, which-- by common sense and definitions contained in
lower-powered Rules-- is a Rule with unusually high Power.  This also
applies to other types of instruments like proposals.  There does seem
to be a traditional definition of 'powerful' as 'having nonzero
power', but it's not currently substantiated by any rule.

But "Dance" is also not defined by the rules, and Agoran game custom
is not mentioned in Rule 754.  According to that rule, by default it
has its ordinary-language meaning, a set of physical motions usually
performed to music.  The word 'dance' is not commonly used
metaphorically in ordinary language, and accordingly we must adopt the
same definition here.  A Powerful Dance is a "series of motions and
steps, usually performed to music" which is especially capable of
exerting (ordinary-language) power.  FALSE.
