============================================================

Arguments of Caller (elJefe):

Just before dissolution of the Reform Group, Steve had 17 Points and
Ronald (Troublemaker at Large) had 14 Points.

Upon dissolution, the Reform Group had 2874 Points (Scorekeepor's Report,
July 25).  Under the Reform Ordinances and Rule 762, the treasury is
divided equally between the departing members, namely elJefe, TAL, and Steve
(Registrar's Report, July 25).  This would indicate that 958 Points be
transferred to each of Steve and Ronald.  The main question of the
CFJ is whether the dissolution transfer was effective in this amount.

Player Ronald is On Hold and has made no transfers since the dissolution.
Player Steve has made only one substantial transfer, of 764 Points to the
Steve's Piggy Bank contest, and no transfers have been made from that Contest.

The dissolution transfer is legal and should take place.  Although Rule
1476 appears to prevent a portion of the transfer, saying that it "does
not take place", rule 762 has precedence over Rule 1476 by virtue of
having a lower Number (Rule 1030).

Some have argued in the Discussion Forum that the phrase "is cancelled
and does not take place" in Rule 1476 is really saying two separate
things, and that "is cancelled" and "does not take place" are separate
prescriptions of the Rule; the "is cancelled" part therefore mandating an
immediate transfer back to the Reform Group of an amount equal to that
disallowed.  This is illogical for at least 3 reasons:

1. Most importantly, it makes the Rule inconsistent within itself.

   This interpretation would have us read the phrase as saying "the
   transfer takes place and a reverse transfer takes place immediately,
   and the transfer does not take place", which is a flat contradiction.

   The only meaningful reading is that "and does not take place" is
   a clarifying phrase for the word "cancelled".

2. Such a "reverse transfer" cannot take place because no Rule requires
   a player to report this kind of involuntary transfer.  Therefore
   by Rule 1472, which has precedence over 1476, the reverse transfer
   would be "cancelled and does not take place".

3. Such an immediate reverse transfer runs up against the mandate
   "This transfer is not taxable" of Rule 762, which takes precedence.

Rule 217 requires the judge to consider past judgement if the
interpretation is unclear.  In case this situation arises, I wish to
remind the court of the Judgement in CFJ 788, which considered the
"cancelled and does not take place" clause in Rule 1472.  Judge Swann
held that the lack of a precedence clause in Rule 1472 makes it
ineffective with respect to transfers under any lower-numbered Rule.
The same should hold for Rule 1476.

============================================================

Arguments of Judge (Zefram):

Rule 1397/0 (Dissolution of Groups) is quite important to this matter.
It states that when a Group is dissolved, the following things happen,
in this order:

 (a) all members of the Group cease to be members;
 (b) all Currencies remaining in the Group's Treasury are
     transferred to their repective issuing entities;
 (c) all Coins issued by the Group are destroyed.

This makes it clear that it is possible for Currencies to remain in the
Group's Treasury, momentarily, after it has ceased to exist and has no
members.

Rule 762/0 states exactly how the Treasury of a dissolved Group is to be
divided between its members, and clearly indicates that the Ordinances
of the Group have no say in the matter.  Clearly the transfers it
requires are Involuntary.  This rule claims precedence over "all other
Rules which determine which Point and Currency transfers are legal
and/or taxable".  No other rule actually states how a Currency transfer
may be "taxed", and at present there is no rule that would make such
transfers illegal.  Therefore this precedence clause, in the current
Ruleset, is superfluous.

Rule 1476/0 limits the extent of Point transfers, both Voluntary and
Involuntary, from Treasuries other than the Bank.  It does not make any
Point transfers illegal, but can limit them in size (in some cases to
zero size).  This does not conflict with any other rule, because there
is no rule that requires a particular transfer to have full effect.

I judge that rules 762/0 and 1476/0 are not in conflict.  Rule 762/0
requires that certain transfers take place, and rule 1476/0 regulates
the size of those transfers.

That is not the end of the matter, however.  It is my opinion that in
this case no Point Transfers of non-zero size were required by rule
762/0.  Note that Rule 762/0 states "... If the Y Ordinances are silent
on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist, ...", and rule 1397/0
states "... Upon the dissolution of a Group, ...", clearly indicating
that a Group being dissolved ceases to exist *before* its currencies are
divided among the members.

Rule 1469/0 (Creation and Destruction of Treasuries) states "Whenever an
Entity which possesses a Treasury ceases to exist ..., all currencies
within are immediately transferred to the Treasuries of the Mintors of
the respective Currencies".  Thus at the moment the Reform group ceased
to exist, *all* Points in its Treasury were transferred to the Bank.

By the time rule 762/0 came into play, the only contents of the Reform
Group Treasury were any Reform Coins that had been in it prior to the
dissolution, which rule 1469/0 required to be transferred right back
into the Reform Group Treasury.  Any such Coins were divided between the
three members as they became ex-members, in accordance with rule 762/0,
and then destroyed in accordance with rule 1397/0.

============================================================

Argument of pro-Speaker (SugarWater)

Judgement: UNKNOWN

I cannot determine the Truth or Falsity of the Caller's statement without 
knowing whether Reform Group has truly dissolved.  Although the consensus 
is that such has happened, until CFJ 795 has been properly dealt with, I 
am unable to make a Judgement.

============================================================

Argument of pro-COTC (Swann)

[Because the question is being decided elsewhere, I am, for the
 purpose of Judging this Statement, ignoring entirely the question
 of whether or not the dissolution of Reform was legal or not.
 As the Caller stated, "The main question of the CFJ is whether the
 dissolution transfer was effective in this amount."  This is what
 I'll address.]

 First I'll address Judge Zefram's arguments against the Statement.
 
 Zefram's entire argument falls upon an erroneous premise:
 
 "That is not the end of the matter, however.  It is my opinion that in
  this case no Point Transfers of non-zero size were required by rule
  762/0.  Note that Rule 762/0 states "... If the Y Ordinances are
  silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist, ...", and
  rule 1397/0 states "... Upon the dissolution of a Group, ...", clearly
  indicating that a Group being dissolved ceases to exist *before* its
  currencies are divided among the members."

  The error is in applying 762/0 after or during the dissolving of
  groups.  762/0, in fact, applies specifically to the general case
  of when "Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y."  This, in fact,
  makes the case exactly opposite of Zefram's argument.  762/0 applies
  when a member *leaves* a group-- *before* the group itself dissolves.
  This happens by virtue of its wording, and by its numerical
  precedence.

  (One might add that part of Judge Zefram's argument supports this
   view.  Rule 1397/0 orders that members leave the Group before
   it dissolves  [only makes sense :)]
   
   In the sequence the Judge quotes:
  
      (a) all members of the Group cease to be members;
      (b) all Currencies remaining in the Group's Treasury are
          transferred to their repective issuing entities;
      (c) all Coins issued by the Group are destroyed.

   Part (a) invokes 762/0 before the rule reaches part (b), even if
   1397/0 appears to say otherwise (762/0 has precedence on the
   matter))

   That leaves the alleged conflict between 762/0 and 1476/0. . .

   Here are the relevant passages:

   From Reform Ordinance 19:

   ". . . The Group shall be dissolved when such a proposal receives
    the consent of the members.  In this case each member of the
    Group receives an equal share of the Treasury upon ceasing to
    be a Member of the dissolving Group."

   From Rule 762/0:

   ". . . If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group
    Y, then Player X shall recieve a share of the contents of the Y
    Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances. . .
    . . . This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules which
    determine which Point and Currency transfers are legal and/or
    taxable."

   From Rule 1476/0:

   ". . .Any transfer of Points, voluntary or involuntary, from any
    Treasury other than the Bank to the Treasury of any Player shall
    be limited to the largest amount such that the Treasury of the
    Player receiving the transfer will not contain more than 90% of
    the Points which that Player would need in order to win.  Any
    portion of a transfer which would violate this requirement is
    cancelled and does not take place."

It is obvious to me that 1476/0 loses in any precedence conflict.
The question is, is there a conflict?  There've been
arguments to the contrary, saying that 1476 serves a limiting
function defining an amount of the transfer.

The argument is that a conflict can't exist unless the transfer
is cancelled in whole, not in part.

In answer to that argument I propose the hypothetical situation:

Group Y has members X and Z.  X has 0 points, Z has 90% of the
Points needed to win.  Group Y dissolves, and tries to disperse
500 Points each to X and Z by virtue of 762/0.  If a limited transfer
is not a conflict, X can only receive 90% of what e needs to win.
But Z's transfer is canceled *entirely*. By the same argument, (ie
that a transfer is only a conflict if the whole transfer is canceled)
Z would get the entire 500 points because of 762's precedence.

Also note that the division of the treasury isn't mandated to be
a single transfer.  The Vizier could have, legally, dispersed the
treasury in hundreds of single-point transfers, or even fractional
point transfers.  Every transfer above 90% would be in conflict
via both interpretations, and 762/0 again would win the precedence
battle.  (In the partial-transfers-don't-conflict universe, X could
get the rest of his points as long as the Vizier made a second
transfer.)

I Rule that, because of the possibility of at least one legal
implementation of 762/0 (multiple transfers) leads to a conflict
eventually, that a conflict indeed exists.  In a conflict, the
precedence clause on 762/0-- and the lack of one on 1476/0--
causes 762/0 to win hands down and the full transfers to be made.

Therefore I must overturn the prior Judgement, and Judge this
TRUE.

[As I said, I have ignored possible alternate states of Reform in
 this Judgement-- ie, whether Reform legally dissolved.  But I think
 that the Rule interpretations are too clear to mandate an UNKNOWN,
 even in the absence of a final appeal on CFJ 765.  I defend myself
 by saying that, in the currently understood Game State the Rules
 should be interpreted in this manner.]

======================================================================

Judgement & Reasoning pro-Justiciar

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons: First of all, the judgement of this is not dependent
on the judgment of CFJ 795. This CFJ has a very broad
Statement "The Rules should be interpreted so that...."
Indeed, I question whether one can CFJ on an interpretation
of *all* Rules. Regardless, it seems clear that I must take into 
consideration the Rules pertaining to the legality of the
dissolution of the Reform Group, since the totals listed
are a direct consequence of Reform's dissolution. However, 
since I do believe Reform dissolved legally, I will
dispense with lengthy argumentation and go on to the important
points. Let us look at Reform Ordinance 19:

19.
      At any time, any Member may Propose dissolution of the Group.
      The Group shall be dissolved when such a proposal receives the
      consent of the members.  In this case each member of the Group
      receives an equal share of the Treasury upon ceasing to be a
      Member of the dissolving Group.

      A member who leaves the Group for any other reason shall not
      receive any share of the Points or Currencies in the Group's
      Treasury.

Rule 762 gives this Ordinance authority. The question is:
does it conflict with Rule 1476? Upon reading it, I claim
the answer can be simply shown to be "No". The Ordinance
claims "each member of the Group receives an equal share
of the Treasury...." NOT "The Treasury shall be divided 
equally among all members". All Ord 19 requires, is for the 
shares to be equal. There is no conflict with Rule 1476,
since that Rule can be put into effect while maintaining
the equality of the shares. Each Player receives X, where
X is the largest amount that doesn't violate 1476 for
any Player. Three differing opinions will, I assume,
uphold the original Judgement, which is the correct one,
but I hope the Scorekeepor will act in accordance with
the conclusions reached by this Justice. I also apologize
for this semantic nitpicking, but my hands are tied. I wish
to assure the plaintiffs that there was no personal animosity
towards their actions or claims

It seems that there are two possibilities concerning the dissolution
of the Reform Group and subsequent transfers. Since I want to do
different things depending on which of the interpretations is eventually
upheld, and since it's too difficult to see at the moment how things
are going to turn out, I wish to make the following conditional
point transfer:

Scorekeepor Kelly,

If my personal Treasury currently contains more than 500 points,
then I hereby transfer 764 points to the Steve's Piggy Bank
Contest Fund.

Of course, kelly will, at least for the moment, interpret the
antecedent of this conditional as being false, and so record
no transfer. However, I trust that should judicial procedures
verify the truth of the antecedent, the transfer will be recorded
- and recorded as having been made at this time.

Rule 762/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Get a Share of the Treasury Upon Leaving

      If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y,
      then Player X shall recieve a share of the contents of the Y
      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes
      precedence over all other Rules which determine which Point and
      Currency transfers are legal and/or taxable.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1030/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Precedence Between Rules with Equal MI's

      If two or more Rules with the same Mutability Indices conflict
      with one another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes
      precedence.  If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly
      says of itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule)
      or takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then
      such provisions shall supercede the numerical method for
      determining precedence.  If two or more Rules claim to take
      precedence over one another or defer to one another, then the
      numerical method again governs.

Rule 1472/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Transfer of Currencies

      The owner of a given Treasury may, at any time, transfer
      any or all of the units of Currency within that Treasury to any
      other Treasury, so long as this transfer is permitted by the
      Rules.  Such a transfer is known as a "voluntary" transfer.
      Voluntary transfers are restricted to positive quantities, and
      in no case may more of a given Currency be transferred from a
      Treasury than that Treasury possessed prior to the transfer.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency must be notified as soon as
      possible by the owner of the Treasury from which a
      voluntary transfer is made.  If a voluntary transfer is not
      reported to the Recordkeepor within seven days, it is cancelled
      and does not take place.

      Transfers which are not voluntary transfers ("involuntary"
      transfers) may only be made as specifically required by the
      Rules.  Such transfers must be reported to the Recordkeepors of
      the Currencies involved as soon as possible thereafter, by a
      Player specified by the Rules.  Involuntary transfers may be of
      any amount (limited only by MUQ rounding), and may involve
      amounts greater than the amount in the Treasury from which the
      transfer originates.

      If an involuntary transfer is not reported to the Recordkeepor
      within seven days, or there is no Rule which requires a Player
      to report the involuntary transfer, the transfer is cancelled
      and does not take place.

      All transfers take effect no sooner than the time the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency is informed of the transfer.

      be limited to the largest amount such that the Treasury of the
      Player receiving the transfer will not contain more than 90% of
      the Points which that Player would need in order to win.  Any
      portion of a transfer which would violate this requirement is
      cancelled and does not take place.

      Transfers of Points from the Bank are never restricted in this
      manner.

All players please note:

I, elJefe, Vizier of the Reform Group, certify that the Ordinances of
the Reform Group have been changed, in accordance with the Ordinances.
The Ordinances now read:

Reform Group Ordinances

0.
      The Purpose of this Group is to facilitate progressive change
      and dynamic growth within the Game of Agora Nomic, while also
      striving to insure the continuity and playability of the same.

1.
      In all matters which require the Consent of the Membership, the
      Vizier shall announce the Matter in the Group's Public Forum,
      and all Members shall indicate their opinion to the Vizier as
      soon as reasonably possible.  Consent of the Membership is
      defined as at least two-thirds of the Active Members in favor
      of the matter at hand.  The matter shall not be resolved until
      either seven days have passed from the Vizier's announcement,
      or matters are such that no possible response from those Active
      Members who have not yet responded could result in a change in
      the consensus opinion. However, if, after seven days, less than
      two-thirds of the Membership has responded at all, the
      consensus shall be that the Membership is silently opposed.

2.
      The Ordinances shall have the power to bind the Active Members
      of the Group to cast their individual Votes on Proposals in a
      manner determined by the Ordinances.  In the event that the
      Ordinances do bind the Membership to Vote upon a Proposal in a
      specified way, no Member may cast a Vote on that Proposal which
      is not in concord with this binding; however, a Member may
      always choose to not Vote upon a given Proposal.

3.
      On each Proposal distributed by the Speaker, the Vizier shall
      seek to determine the consensus opinion of the Group of how the
      Membership of the Group shall vote.  Each Member may express
      exactly one of the options specified below, or may indicate that
      e has no opinion; if any of these options is favored by at least
      two-thirds of those Members expressing an opinion, the
      Membership shall be bound by the terms of that option, provided
      that at least two-thirds of the Membership has responded at all
      prior to the end of the Voting Period for that Proposal.  If no
      consensus of opinion is reached by the time that 24 hours remain
      of the Voting Period of a Proposal, then the Membership shall be
      free to Vote as they are individually inclined on that Proposal.

      The options are:
      * to vote FOR the Proposal;
      * to Vote AGAINST the Proposal;
      * to ABSTAIN on the Proposal;
      * to allow the Members to vote however they please on that
        Proposal (UNBOUND);
      * to direct the Vizier to solicit bids from the Electorate at
        large for the privilege of designating the manner in which the
        Group Members shall be bound to Vote (SOLD).

      When the consensus opinion of the Group on a specific Proposal
      is to offer the Group's Votes up for sale, the Vizier shall post
      an announcement to all Active Players advising them that the
      Membership of the Group offers its votes on that Proposal to the
      Player who bids the largest number of the Coin of the Group for
      that privilege. Members of the Reform Group may not enter bids
      in the sale of the Group's votes, nor may any Player who has
      been a Member of the Reform Group during the 10 days previous to
      the time the auction is announced.

      Bids shall be in the form of transfers of a positive number of
      Reform Group Coins to the Reform Group Treasury. A Player makes
      a bid by sending a message to the Vizier of the Group indicating
      which Proposal e is bidding on, how much e is bidding, and the
      manner in which e wishes to direct the Group to vote if eir bid
      is successful. At any time, a Player's bid on a particular
      Proposal for which the Group's votes are up for sale shall be
      the total number of Coins which that Player has transferred to
      the Reform Group Treasury in bids on that Proposal.

      The Vizier shall accept bids until 72 hours prior to the end of
      the Voting Period on the Proposal.  The Vizier shall then notify
      the highest bidder, if there is one, that e has won the auction.
      All unsuccessful bids are then returned to their respective
      bidders.

      If there is a successful bid, then the Membership of the Group
      shall be bound to vote as the successful bidder has indicated.
      Otherwise the Membership shall be free to vote as they please.

      One half of the Coins transferred in a successful bid, rounded
      up, shall be distributed as evenly as possible among the active
      members of the Group; the remainder, along with any fraction
      unable to be evenly distributed, shall be destroyed.

4.
      The Vizier may expend Points or Currencies held in the Group's
      Treasury for any purpose, but only as specified in the
      Ordinances or with the Consent of the Membership.

5.
      New Members may be admitted to the Group with the consent of the
      Membership.  The Name of a New Member shall be added to the
      bottom of the List of Members.

6.
      An existing Member may be expelled from the Group with the
      consent of the Membership.  For the purpose of determining the
      Consent of the Membership in a matter of expulsion, the Member
      being considered for expulsion shall have no voice.

7.
      Whenever a Member leaves the Group for any reason, eir name
      shall be removed from the List of Members.

8.
      A Member may, at any time, request that eir name be moved to the
      bottom of the List of Members.

9.
      The Vizier may, at any time, nominate another Member as eir
      nominated successor, who shall become Vizier in the event of a
      vacancy, and may retract any such nomination at any time.  All
      such nominations and retractions shall be made to the Group's
      Public Forum.

10.
      The Vizier may resign as Vizier at any time, with or without
      leaving the Group.  Should the Vizier resign without nominating
      a successor, e shall be expelled from the Group.

11.
      In the event that the Group might otherwise have no Vizier, the
      Vizier's nominated successor shall become Vizier.  If there is
      no nominated successor, or the nominated successor is
      ineligible, the first Member on the List of Members shall become
      Vizier.  If there is no such Member, the Group shall be
      dissolved.

12.
      The Vizier shall, in addition to eir other duties, maintain a
      record of the nominated successors to all Group Offices, and
      maintain the List of Members in the order required by these
      Ordinances, and make this information ailable to any Member
      upon request.

13.
      The Vizier shall, at all times, be the Ordinancekeepor.

14.
      These Ordinances may be changed only with the consent of the
      Membership.  No change in the Ordinances can have a retroactive
      effect, nor cause any action already performed by a member of
      the Group to become void or illegal under the Ordinances or the
      Rules.

15.
      The Vizier may create or destroy Coins of the Group at any time
      for any purpose, but only as specified in the Ordinances or with
      the Consent of the Membership.

16.
      The Vizier shall permit Players to purchase Coins of the Group
      from the Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of
      Exchange.  If a Service Fee applies to the transaction, the
      number of Coins received shall be reduced by the amount of the
      Service Fee.

      A Player who wishes to purchase Coins may do so by transferring
      a sufficient number of Points to the Group Treasury.  When the
      Scorekeepor has confirmed the Point Transfer, the Vizier shall
      transfer the appropriate number of Coins to that Player,
      creating Coins if necessary.

      The current Service Fee is equal to 5% of the transaction, not
      to be less than 1 Coin, or to exceed 50 Coins.  This fee does
      not apply to members of the Reform Group.

17.
      The Vizier shall permit Players to sell Coins of the Group back
      to the Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of
      Exchange.  A Player who wishes to sell Coins back to the Group
      may do so by transferring the Coins e wishes to sell to the
      Group Treasury.  The Vizier shall then transfer the appropriate
      number of Points from the Group Treasury to that Player.  The
      transferred Coins shall then be destroyed.

18.
      The Rate of Exchange for Coins of the Group shall be the ratio
      between the number of Coins of the Group in existence (less
      those held in the Group's Treasury) and the number of Points
      held in the Group's Treasury.  This ratio determines the number
      of Coins received in exchange for one Point, or the number of
      Coins needed to receive one Point.

19.
      At any time, any Member may Propose dissolution of the Group.
      The Group shall be dissolved when such a proposal receives the
      consent of the members.  In this case each member of the Group
      receives an equal share of the Treasury upon ceasing to be a
      Member of the dissolving Group.

      A member who leaves the Group for any other reason shall not
      receive any share of the Points or Currencies in the Group's
      Treasury.

Regards,
- elJefe, Reform Group Vizier
