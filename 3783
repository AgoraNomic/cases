[Note: I have included the text of the proposals themselves, rather than 
the text in the recent SLR, because the resolutions are more easily 
verifiable, and I don't completely trust my SLR right now, for previously 
stated reasons.]


Caller's Arguments:

Under the precedent set in CFJ 1584, performing an action 1000 by saying 
that one does is acceptable. Furthermore, I argue that the precedent in 
CFJ 1774 does not override this - this action does not create thousands of 
things that must be dealt with individually (such as CFJs); it can be 
dealt with by updating a few lines in the Tresasuror's report (and perhaps 
adding an explanatory note), so I argue that my actions do not constitute 
an "abuse of other player's time and efforts". Thus I argue that I was 
indeed able to perform the actions in this message 1000 times.

Assuming the above is accepted, then I have won the election 1000 times 
and, after each win, earned 18 coins. The earning of coins is effective 
because there are 17 players who do not possess an Emerald ribbon (19 
players total, minus me and G.), and I did not earn any additional ribbons 
between earning the Emerald ribbon and claiming the reward of coins, 
fulfilling the criteria in "Glitter".

Thus, I argue that I have earned 18000 Coins, so I have more than 2000 
Coins. I argue that this CFJ should be judged TRUE. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

The election "ends" after the first announcement:

>       When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
>       office and the election ends.

It's important to decide (by common definitions) what properties an "ended
election" has.  An "election that has ended" may or may not still exist, 
but common definitions would say it doesn't have "a single candidate" any 
longer (the condition necessary to enable the announcement), rather it's 
an "election with a winner".

Further, if the callers' arguments are accepted, it leads to a potential
problem.  The term "in progress" isn't defined. By common definitions, if 
a winner can still be declared, then the election is still in progress, 
even if another part of the rule says it has "ended".  The caller's
interpretation would let us look at this clause:

>       The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
>       initiated if one is already in progress.

and conclude that all past uncontested elections (1) can still have a 
winner announced and installed in office, therefore (2) they are still "in
progress" therefore (3) no subsequent elections for those offices were 
ever started.
