Judgment: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The caller's arguments are persuasive, as they often are when the
caller has lived with the Rules as long as Chuck.

As he points out, Rule 1517 explicitly states that 'casting a Power'
is an operation specified "as provided by the Rule defining that
Power."

Rule 1520 defines the Immunity power and enumerates the effects of
casting it, but does not actually specify the procedure. In the face
of Rule 1517's explicit requirement, and Rule 1011, there is a clear
bar on casting the Power of Immunity.

I mention in passing that this argument does not apply to the casting
of the Frankenstein Monster.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I hereby Call For Judgement on the following statement:

It is not possible to cast the Power of Immunity.

Arguments:

Rule 1517 states, "A Player uses a Power by 'casting' it as
provided by the Rule defining that Power."  Although Rule
1520 defines the Power of Immunity, and the effects of
casting it, Rule 1520 does not describe how the Power
of Immunity is cast.  (All other Power-defining Rules
contain explicit instructions as to how those Powers are cast.)
Thus, by Rule 1011, the Power of Immunity may not be cast.

Evidence: (Rule 1517, Rule 1520, Rule 1011)

Rule 1517/4 (MI=1)
Definition of the Powers

      There is a class of Nomic Entities called the Powers. An Entity
      is a Power if and only if it designated by the Rules to be so.
      Powers are a Currency. The Mintor of the Powers is the Mint.
      The Recordkeepor for the Powers is the Assessor.

      Instances of Powers are called Cards.  A Player uses a Power by
      'casting' it as provided by the Rule defining that Power. A
      Player may cast a Power only if e possesses a Card of that
      Power.

      Powers may only be cast by Active Players. A Player must inform
      the Assessor whenever e casts a Power, otherwise the Power is
      not legally cast.

      The casting Player is called the Caster. Rules which create
      specific Powers may specify that that Power may not be cast or
      may only be cast by certain Players, or on certain Players.

      If the casting of a Power requires the specification by the
      Caster of a Proposal or Proposals to which it applies, then all
      Proposals so specified by the Caster must be ones for which the
      Voting Period has commenced and not yet concluded, or the Power
      is not legally cast. If a Card of such a Power is legally
      cast, it is In Limbo until the Voting Periods of all specified
      Proposals have ended.

      The following are generally true of all Cards, unless a Rule
      defining a specific Power says otherwise of the Power which
      that Rule defines:

      1) exactly one Card of a given type exists at any time.
      2) when a Card is not held by any Player, it is held by
         the Bank.
      3) provided that the Bank holds at least one Card of a
         given type, Players may purchase a Card of that type
         from the Bank.
      4) the purchase price of a Card is 10 Mil.
      5) If a Player does not use a Card within a week of having
         acquired it, either from the Bank or from another Player,
         it is returned to the Bank.
      6) a Player who possesses a Card but who has not yet made
         use of it may trade it to another Player as e sees fit.
      7) Cards which are In Limbo may not be cast.

      The Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting all
      transfers which occur as a result of the use of Powers.

      At least once each Nomic week, the Assessor shall post a Report
      to the Public Forum, including a list of all transfers of Powers
      since the previous such Report, and the current ownership of all
      Powers.

Rule 1520/3 (MI=1)
The Power of Immunity

      There is a Power called the Power of Immunity. There are 4
      Immunity Cards. A Player who possesses an Immunity Card may
      only cast the Power on emself. A Player upon whom the Power
      of Immunity is cast is called an Immune Player.  A Card of the
      Power of Immunity is in Limbo for ten days after it is cast.

      The effect of the Power of Immunity is to neutralize the
      effects of Powers upon the Immune Player, other than those
      Powers cast by the Immune Player emself, for a period
      commencing three days prior to the casting of the Power, and
      concluding ten days after the Power is cast. A Power which is
      neutralized in this way is called a Neutralized Power. The
      Power of Immunity does not cancel the castings of Neutralized
      Powers upon an Immune Player; rather, it deprives them of any
      effects on an Immune Player which they might otherwise have.

      The purchase price of a Power which is Neutralized because a
      Player is Immune is transferred from the Bank to the Caster of
      the Neutralized Power. For a Neutralized Power which has been
      cast prior to the casting of the Power of Immunity, this
      transfer takes place when the Power of Immunity is cast. For a
      Neutralized Power which is cast after the Power of Immunity is
      cast, this transfer takes place at the time the Neutralized
      Power is cast. The Assessor is responsible for detecting these
      transfers and reporting them to the appropriate Recordkeepor.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules which define
      specific Powers.

      If this Rule conflicts in its effects with those of another
      Rule defining a specific Power, then the conflict shall be
      resolved according to the Rule for determining precedence
      among Powers.

Rule 1011/3 (MI=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      A "Nomic Property" is any property of any entity which that
      entity possesses solely by the virtue of the Rules defining that
      property.

      No Nomic Property shall be changed except in accordance with
      procedures specified by the Rules.

[CFJ 700: Neither nicknames nor Players are "created by the Nomic
 Rules, and exist only within the context of Agora Nomic."
 CFJs 815 & 816: If an amendment is made which changes the properties
 of an Entity, the Entity changes to conform to the new Rule, rather
 than the destruction of the old Entities.  If the old Entity has
 the same name as the new Entity, that implies continuity of that
 Entity if at all possible.]
