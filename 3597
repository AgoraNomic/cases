Caller's Arguments:

Exhibit 1 contains 1,011 payments to Agora of 1 sh. apiece, substantially made 
by V.J Rada and identified as being payments for the purchase of the Estate. 
V.J Rada was authorized to purchase that Estate, as exhibit 2 shows, e had 
recently won an auction.

Shinies are fungible (see exhibits 3 and 4): any two collections of shinies 
with the same number of shinies in them and the same owner are fully 
interchangeable, and are in fact indistinguishable from one another, as we 
lack the means to identify any single shiny with any certainty. Similarly, 
dividing a payment into multiple smaller payments is neither permitted nor 
proscribed by the rules, and after receiving 1,011 shinies, Agora is exactly 
as enriched if those shinies come in a single payment, or in multiple 
payments.

Conversely, however, the 1,011 payments in exhibit 1 are evidently not 
_atomic_. They are, by necessity, interleaved with other actions involving the 
same parties (V.J Rada and Agora). If we are to treat all 1,011 payments as a 
unit, in what order does that payment occur with respect to the 1,011 payments 
Agora makes in that message?

Exhibit 5 is the only relevant CFJ I'm aware of. I judged it, and I stand by 
it.

Judge Aris's Arguments:

The caller's arguments do a pretty good job of summing up the situation.
V.J. Rada had to pay 1,011 shinies to Agora; instead of paying them at once,
as is customary, e paid them 1 by 1 (through an Agent, o) with other actions
interleaved between them. The question is whether these actions succeeded
in fulfilling V.J. Rada's obligation and allowing em to obtain the Estate of
Erehwon. I now rule that they did not.

First, the question arises of whether the closely related CFJ 3552 applies here.
I rule that it does not. CFJ 3552 ruled that if an action is clearly intended
to accomplish a specific goal, and it fails to accomplish that goal, it
entirely fails. There was no implication that these actions were individual
action were intended to accomplish anything, indeed, it was clear from the
language used that they were only supposed to accomplish something collectively
(the phrasing was "pay Agora 1 shiny towards the purchase of the Estate of
Erewhon.").

As the caller points out in eir arguments, the attempted actions are just that,
multiple actions. This is a problem, because Rule 2491 specifies that
"The winner CAN cause Agora to transfer the auctioned Estate to emself by
announcement, if e pays Agora the amount of the bid for the explicit and sole
purpose of fulfilling this requirement." The use of the word "pays" suggests
that the payment must be one occurrence, not many occurrences over a period of
time. The payments here did not meet that bar, because there were clearly many
separate, individual, single shiny payments. I note here that "by paying",
another phrase used throughout the rules, has similar connotations of a single
payment. On the other hand, if a rule used the past tense ("has paid") then it
could be as many separate payments as the player liked.

However, there is another problem that surfaces under the single action
rule adopted above. Rule 2166 specifies that "An asset generally CAN be
transferred (syn. paid, given) by announcement by its owner to another entity,
subject to modification by its backing document." No language there allows
multiple transfers to be a single action. Do all auction payments, or worse,
payments in general, of more than one shiny fail? They do not. We have
collectively determined that a group of payments succeeds or fails as a whole.
That is atomicity enough to satisfy Rule 2166. This principle is in line with
the general idea, adopted from computer science, that a group of atomic
actions can be ended collectively atomic. I will refer to such a group of
actions as a "compound action".

So, are the actions in this case actually one compound action? What difference
does it make that they are spread out? Quite a bit of difference. First, our
perception that a group of actions are actually one compound action is based on
them being rendered one action by being in a clearly delimited textual
structure. The actions here were in multiple paragraphs, separated by other
actions, so there is no reason to regard them as atomic.

The other problem with viewing these actions as a single action is that they
have external dependencies, i.e. they depend upon other actions of unlike kind,
which in turn depend upon them. An action that cannot be accomplished in one
instant is not atomic. Here the success of each action depended on the
completion of the action before it. A shiny was transferred from V.J. Rada to
Agora, then a shiny was transferred the other direction, and so on. The
problem is that V.J. Rada had to receive a shiny from Agora to have enough
shinies to go on, as Agora needed the shinies for V.J. to continue giving them
back. It would have been impossible to otherwise make the payment,
because the 1011 shinies purportedly paid were in excess of the total
number of shinies in circulation. These actions were clearly separate from
one another.

Because V.J. Rada did not pay 1011 shinies as a single action, eir purchase
failed, and this CFJ is FALSE. E retains all of eir shinies, because they did
not in the end accomplish their clearly stated goal. E failed in eir obligation
to make the full payment. o was complicit in this, but under current rules
cannot be punished. E has presented compelling arguments about why e acted the
way e did [1], but is nevertheless reminded about the importance of maintaining
impartiality in eir official actions.

Judge Aris's Evidence

Rule 2491/6 (Power=2)
Estate Auctions

  At the start of each month, if Agora owns at least one Estate, the
  Surveyor CAN and SHALL put one Estate that is owned by Agora up
  for auction by announcement. Each auction ends seven days after it
  begins.

  During an auction, any player or contract may bid a number of
  Shinies by announcement, provided that the bid is higher than all
  previously-placed bids in the same auction.

  If, at the end of the auction, there is a single highest bid, then
  the player or contract who placed that bid wins the auction. The
  winner CAN cause Agora to transfer the auctioned Estate to emself
  by announcement, if e pays Agora the amount of the bid for the
  explicit and sole purpose of fulfilling this requirement. The
  person who placed the bid SHALL see to it that this is done in a
  timely fashion.

Rule 2166/23 (Power=3)
Assets

  An asset is an entity defined as such by a (a) rule, (b) authorized
  regulation, (c) group of rules and/or authorized regulations (but if
  such regulations modify a preexisting asset class defined by a rule or
  another title of regulations, they must be authorized specifically to
  do so by their parent rule), or (d) contract (hereafter its backing
  document), and existing solely because its backing document defines
  its existence. An asset's backing document can specify when and how
  that asset is created, destroyed, and transferred.

  Each asset has exactly one owner. If an asset would otherwise lack an
  owner, it is owned by Agora.  If an asset's backing document restricts
  its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained
  by or transferred to an entity outside that class, and is destroyed if
  it is owned by an entity outside that class (except if it is owned by
  Agora, in which case any player CAN transfer or destroy it without
  objection). The restrictions in the previous sentence are subject to
  modification by its backing document.

  Unless modified by an asset's backing document, ownership of an asset
  is restricted to Agora, players, and contracts. As an exception to the
  last sentence, non-player persons are generally able to own assets
  defined by a contract they are a party to, subject to modification by
  the contract in question.

  A contract's text can specify whether or not that contract is willing
  to receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, a contract CANNOT
  be given assets it is unwilling to receive. If the contract is silent
  on the matter, or if its willingness is indeterminate or the subject
  of a inextricable conditional, the procedure to determine its
  willingness is as follows:

    1. If the contract appears to anticipate being given assets, other
       than for sustenance (e.g. by authorizing parties to spend the
       contract's assets), then the contract is willing to receive all
       assets.

    2. Otherwise, it is unwilling to receive all assets.

  The previous paragraph (including the list) notwithstanding, a
  contract CAN be given 1 shiny a month for its sustenance payment, so
  long as it never has more than 1 shiny at a time.

  The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any) defined
  as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That entity's report
  includes a list of all instances of that class and their owners.  This
  portion of that entity's report is self-ratifying. Rules to the
  contrary notwithstanding, a contract CANNOT oblige a person who isn't
  a member to record its internal state, nor is the default recordkeepor
  responsible for tracking a contract's internal state. For the purposes
  of this rule, the promulgator of a regulation is bound by it.

  An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
  subject to modification by its backing document. An indestructible
  asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT be
  destroyed except by a rule, other than this one, specifically
  addressing the destruction of indestructible assets or that asset in
  particular; any other asset is destructible. In circumstances where
  another asset would be destroyed, an indestructible asset is generally
  transferred to Agora, subject to modification by its backing document
  and the intervention of other rules.

  To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's possession; to
  "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it from that entity's
  possession.

  An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. paid, given) by
  announcement by its owner to another entity, subject to modification
  by its backing document. A fixed asset is one defined as such by its
  backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is
  liquid.

  When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
  number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
  number.

  A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
  document. Instances of a currency with the same owner are fungible.

  The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number of
  x that entity possesses. If a rule, proposal, or other competent
  authority attempts to increase or decrease the balance of an entity
  without specifying a source or destination, then the currency is
  created or destroyed as needed.

  When a player causes one or more balances to change, e is ENCOURAGED
  to specify the resulting balance(s). Players SHOULD NOT specify
  inaccurate balances.

  Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or currency being referred to
  is the currency designated as "Agora's official currency", if there is
  one.

  An asset or class of assets is private, rather than public, if its
  backing document is a contract.
