Caller's arguments: 

There's an impedance mismatch between the rules on
petitions (which are indeed limited to officers) and my clear intent (to
petition G. specifically). Could that text be interpreted as "if G.
wasn't PM, then the petition was ineffective due to lack of clarity"?

Here's the ADoP report addressing G. possibly being PM at the time in
question:

https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-official/2021-February/014626.html

I thought there was a CFJ that e wasn't, but I couldn't find one. Later
ADoP reports maintained the assumption that e wasn't, and they weren't
disputed on that basis (though their self-ratification may not have
affected this particular point, as Trigon was uncontroversially elected
PM on Feb 14, and the next ADoP report reflected that, only addressing
the previous question by omission from the non-self-ratifying history
section).

--------------------------------------------------------------

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

Counterarguments:  when chosing words that have clear legal effect
(petition) and a clear rules target (offices) and an office is clearly
mentioned (prime minister, even if the announcement is qualified by
"possibly prime minister"), and the action only works in one set of
circumstances (as a petition to the PM), deference in ambiguity should be
given to the rules process that was explicitly invoked.

Not sure if it matters, CFJ was called 07 Feb 2021 15:32:46.  So the
petition was made before any doubts were expressed formally (in the ADoP
report or the CFJ).

--------------------------------------------------------------

Judge ais523's arguments:

There are two sub-issues to this CFJ:

a) does Rule 2143 mean "petition a person who holds at least one
office", or "petition an office, delivering the petition to the
officeholder as the representative of that office"?

b) if Rule 2143 does require a particular office to be referenced, does
Murphy's message succeed in identifying the Prime Minister as the
office in question?

At the heart of issue a), this is a dispute about what Rule 2143 is
referring to when it says "A player CAN, by announcement, petition a
specified officer to take a specified action; the officer SHALL
publicly respond to the petition in a timely fashion."; is "officer"
being used in the sence of a "person who holds at least one office", or
is it being used in the sense of "you can petition an office by
petitioning the officer"? It's clear (rule 2160p1) that if the action
is linked to the player, rather than the office, the deputisation
wouldn't work.

As for b): to me, the plain language of the wording of Murphy's message
is "I petition G., who is possibly the Prime Minister". If we imagine a
slight change in the message, "I petition G.; I know e's an officer,
but can't remember whether it's Prime Minister or Arbitor", I wouldn't
expect this to be a substantial change in the meaning of Murphy's
message as it related to the petitioning. (I note in passing that G.'s
statement that e couldn't respond to the petition, because e wasn't the
prime minster, is wrong; maybe e couldn't fulfil a duty to respond, but
it's perfectly possible to publicly respond to other people's petitions
by posting an email containing a response. There isn't a defined action
of "responding to a petition".)

Rule 478 says "Where the rules define an action that a person CAN
perform "by announcement", that person performs that action by
unambiguously and clearly specifying the action". Murphy's message
unambiguously and clearly specified an attempt to petition G., but I
don't think it's identifying an attempt to petition a particular office
sufficiently clearly (it's *mentioning* an office but there's no
implication in the sentence that that office is the target of a
petitioning; the mention of the Prime Minster looks more like "I think
this petitioning is legal because G. is the Prime Minister, and it
needs to be aimed at an officer" rather than "I aim this petition at
the office of the Prime Minister, which happens to be held by G."). So
the action that Murphy describes (petitioning a person) is not the
action of petitioning that's defined in the rules, and thus it fails to
create a rules-defined duty.

So, we can see a link between points a) and b) here. If petitions are
directed at a specific person (who happens to hold at least one
office), then the petitioning worked, but it isn't possible to deputise
to answer. If petitions are directed at an office, the petitioning
failed. In either case, the CFJ is FALSE.

It's still interesting to know which of these two scenarios actually
happened, though (with the understanding that it doesn't affect the
outcome of the CFJ). Looking at the uses of "office" vs. "officer" in
the rules (in situations where the rules want to talks about officers
in general):

R2162: "one office" … "that officer"
R1607,2137,1051: "one office" … "its holder"
R2164: "appoint and remove officeholders"
R1006: "An officer is the holder of an office, who may be referred to
by the name of that office."
R2630: "each officer" … "eir own office"
R2154: "a specified elected office" … "holder of that office"
R2573: "the holder of a specified elected office"
R2160: "an action ordinarily reserved for an office-holder as if e held
the office"
R2138: "each office's Officeholder" (referring to the switch, not the
officer!)
R2143: "a specified officer" … "the officer" (what this CFJ is about)
R2603: "which would otherwise lack an officer" (presumably this isn't
supposed to trigger when there's a defined officer, but it's vacant)
R2496: "the officer associated with the condition" (followed by a list
of office names associated with conditions)
R2581: "any officer" … "not holding that office"
R2582: "the indicated officers" … "each indicated officer"

Most of the rules are very clear on the office vs. Officeholder switch
vs. person distinction. However, some are less clear, and give a window
into what the game custom surrounding references to "officers" is. In
particular, the wording in R2630 and R2581 is fairly persuasive to me
that the custom is that "officers" are colloquially considered to be a
different concept from the individual people who hold the offices; G.-
as-Prime-Minister is a different "officer" from G.-as-Arbitor.
Otherwise, they would effectively imply that nobody could hold more
than one office, which is obviously incorrect. R2160, R2603 and R2496
give more evidence on the subject, and although it's less clear, it
points in the same direction.

It's also worth noting that the construction in R2582 is very similar
to the construction in R2143. However, R2582 indicates a list of office
names. I think it makes sense to interpret R2143 so that the words
would be being used in the same way that they're used in R2582.

So a summary of my findings:
- it is the case that petitions are directed at an office, so you can
deputise to answer them
- but Murphy failed to clearly take the action of directing a petition
at an office (it's clear what action e was trying to take – directing a
petition at a person – but that action doesn't have any defined rules
effect, so it doesn't create a duty to respond)
- so no obligation was created, and so no deputisation, FALSE.

I judge CFJ 3916 FALSE.
