Caller's Arguments:

While this contains a conditional referring a hypothetical future
situation, that situation is not indeterminate, as I specified "in the
next instant, before any other process regulated by the ruleset of Agora
takes place", meaning it can be unambiguously logically derived from the
present situation (that is, the present situation - my first message and
the withdrawal + my second message = the hypothetical future situation).

Judge's Arguments following Reconsideration:

When judging 3646, I forgot that it was at the time reliant on CFJ
3647 being judged TRUE. Now that it has been judged as FALSE, and
ATMunn did not in fact vote FOR, I file a motion to reconsider CFJ
3646 and judge it FALSE.

Corona voted in this way

The question presented is whether this conditional vote evaluates FOR
each proposal, where the previous five votes were FOR each proposal. I
hold that it does. The intent of the conditional is clear. It wants to
vote in such a way that if someone else voted the same as the previous
voters including this one, they would vote FOR. That's basically the
same thing as saying that Corona voted in the same way as five
previous voters on the proposals, which is FOR. This text is not
ambiguous, in that its aim is clear and no reasonable Agoran reading
carefully over it would believe it to be anything but a vote FOR each
proposal. The conditional is not inextricable, as the condition
depends on one clearly defined occurrence with no intervening rules
processes.

This CFJ is TRUE
