==========================================================================

Judge Jason's Arguments:

Rule 683 states that "An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision
by publishing a notice satisfying [...]". This means that submitting a
ballot is an action taken instantly by publishing certain text (i.e. it
is not continuously evaluated by retrospectively evaluating these
conditions, as was done by the previous iteration of dependent actions).
This means that second paragraph of R2466 does not prohibit acting on
behalf to perform this action.

The conditions set forth in R683 are evaluated as if the agent was the
principal, since no rule explicitly states otherwise. There are clearly
a set of circumstances under which the principal could cast the ballot,
so there are also sets of circumstances under which the agent could cast
the ballot. It is thus POSSIBLE, under certain circumstances, to act on
behalf to cast a ballot.

However, the fact that this is possible in the abstract does not mean
that it's possible in any current circumstances. If the caller wanted
that to be evaluated, e should have made a more specific CFJ. Judged
DISMISS for lack of specificity about the circumstances in the statement.


Judge Jason's Evidence:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2466/2 (Power=3)
Acting on Behalf

      When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of
      another (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN
      perform the action if it is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so,
      taking into account any prerequisites for the action. If the
      enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which the agent
      may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same
      manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional
      requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
      action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the
      action is being taken on behalf of that person.

      A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so
      causes the second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act
      on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
      action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
      person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
      might be taken within a message, including actions that would
      otherwise be taken by publishing certain text.

      When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
      action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed
      by the principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is
      treated differently for some purpose, in which case it is treated
      as described by that rule.

      Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at
      power 2.0. This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      prohibit a person from taking an action, except that it defers to
      any rule that imposes limitations specifically on actions taken on
      behalf of another person.

Rule 683/27 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:

      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         decision.

      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the decision, a player.

      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
         the voting method.

      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.

      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.

      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not been
      withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision, an
      entity CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot that e
      submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to retract
      eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one. Submitting
      and withdrawing ballots is secured.
