========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

scshunt was not the defendant in CFJ 3054.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Yally:

[CotC: ineffective because prejudice not specified, see CFJ 3098]

I agree with scshunt's arguments. Destroying the points all at once is
permitted
by the rules, even if it is a mistake in the rules. Trying to catch him on
some
other issue that the courts already DISMISSED in order to make-up for him
cleverly circumventing the rules does not seem appropriate. I opine
OVERRULE/NOT GUILTY.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Machiavelli:

[CotC: opinion OVERRULE/NOT GUILTY ineffective because prejudice not
specified, see CFJ 3098]

========================================================================

Panelist woggle's Arguments:

The subject of CFJ 3054 (and the subsequent case I judged GUILTY -
DISCHARGE) was omd, not scshunt. I opine REMAND with prejudice.
