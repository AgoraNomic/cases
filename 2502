I support both intents, and initiate the appeal.

Judge BobTHJ's Arguments:

To answer the caller's arguments: No, it does not matter which intent
caused the appeal as far as I can determine. Completing either intent
would initiate the same action and therefore completing one or both in
the quoted message did cause CFJ 2502 to be appealed. I rule TRUE.
