I hereby make the following Call for Judgement. I bar Vanyel and Ian.
======================================================================
			ASSIGNMENT CFJ 808

Ian's creation of 3 Win Tokens and transfer of them to Vanyel at
Fri, 15 Sep 1995 15:38:14 -0700 did not cause Vanyel to win the game.

======================================================================

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Steve, 21 Sep, 11:29 +1000 (EST)
  Assigned to Andre, 21 Sep, 11:32 METDST
  Assignment upheld, 25 Sep, 12:02 MET
  Judged TRUE by Andre, 25 Sep, 12:28 MET

======================================================================

Reasons and Arguments:

Tabulator Ian reported that Vanyel became a Winner by Tokens in his
Report of Sep 15.  Here's the relevant excerpt form his Report:

>Ian1 (WT created) --> Vanyel
>Ian2 (WT created) --> Vanyel
>Ian3 (WT created) --> Vanyel
>Fri, 15 Sep 1995 15:38:14 -0700
>
>Vanyel currently possesses at least 20 more
>Win Tokens than Andre (=any other player).
>E is therefore "the Winner (a Win by Tokens)."
>
>Vanyel     0      0 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3=21

Here's the relevant part of Rule 1492:

      A Player not on Hold becomes the Winner (a Win By Tokens) when
      the number of Win Tokens e possesses is at least X greater than
      the number of Win Tokens possessed by any other Player at that
      time. X is the number of Players at the time the previous Game
      ended.

Tabulator Ian's claim that Vanyel wins the game with 21 Win Tokens
rests on his interpreting the phrase "any other Player" in Rule 1492
to mean "some other (one or arbitrarily chosen) Player", rather than
"all other Players". But is this interpretation reasonable? I don't
think so. Not only is it highly unidiomatic, it is inconsistent with
the way the phrased is used in the rest of the Ruleset. Specifically,
I claim that in all other places in the Ruleset where the phrase "any
other Player" occurs, and where both readings are at least in
principle available (because neither are ruled out by contextual
considerations), and where it makes a difference, we should and do
read "any other Player" to mean "all other Players", and not "some
other (one or arbitrarily chosen) Player".

Rule 1006 (Defaults for Officers):

      It is forbidden for two or more Players to hold the same Office
      at the same time.  If the Rules require that a specific Player
      fill an Office, any other Player who currently fills that Office
      ceases to do so simultaneously.

A key case: note that the first sentence refers to "two or more" Players.
Let's say that for some reason two Players are held to simultaneously
hold the same Office. Now, a third person is required by the Rules to
fill that Office. Obviously, *all* the other Players who hold the
Office cease to fill the Office, not just some one arbitrarily chosen
of them.

Rule 1064 (Freedom of Information Act):

      If a Player is mandated by the Rules to maintain a set of
      records, these records must be available for public perusal,
      unless such records are designated by the Rules as private.  A
      Player who maintains such records must provide a copy of these
      Records to any other Player upon request within one week.

Obviously, the Recordkeepor is required to honour *all* such requests
in a given week, not just some one arbitrarily chosen among them.

Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold):

      A Player may not place any other Player besides emself on Hold.

Again, obviously, the restriction applies to all other Players, not
just some one arbitrarily chosen Player.

In short, I argue that for Vanyel to win the game by Tokens, he must
have at least 20 (21 now that Alex Coco has joined) more Win Tokens
than all other Players (considered individually). At the time of
Tabulator Ian's Report, Steve had 3 Win Tokens, and Vanyel 21. So
Vanyel had only 18 more Win Tokens than Steve, and so Ian's transfer
did not cause Vanyel to win the game.

======================================================================

Judgement & Reasoning Judge:


Basically I agree with the caller that the meaning of "any other Player" here
means "all other Players individually", not "some arbitrarily chosen other
Player". To add something useful to the discussion, I will give a few
places in the ruleset where the word 'any' is used in a context very
similar to the one we are discussing, as I think the Caller's examples
are not very good in their similarity. Here are my analogies:

Rule 1023 (Definition of ASAP):
Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
"as soon as possible", e is required to perform that action
within a week, and no later than any other action e is 
subsequently required to perform. [...]

So, next time we can say: "Yes, there were things I was subsequently
required to perform which I did before I did something I was to do
ASAP, but I did not break Rule 1023, because there were things that I
did later as well..."?!?

Rule 1036 (Making and Distributing Proposals):
[...]
Within seven (7) days of the receipt of the Proposals, and not
later than any subsequently received Proposal, the Promoter
shall distribute the numbered Proposal to all Players.
[...]

Vanyel currently possesses at least 20 more
Win Tokens than Andre (=any other player).
E is therefore "the Winner (a Win by Tokens)."

Winning by Tokens

      A Player not on Hold becomes the Winner (a Win By Tokens) when
      the number of Win Tokens e possesses is at least X greater than
      the number of Win Tokens possessed by any other Player at that
      time. X is the number of Players at the time the previous Game

----- 3. Rule 1006

Rule 1006/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Defaults for Officers

      Offices are a class of Nomic Entities, referring generically
      to a position of authority or responsibility in Agora Nomic.

      Only those Offices specifically established by the Rules.  If an
      Office ceases to be specified in the Rules, it ceases to exist.

      An Officer is any Player who fills an Office as specified in the
      Rules.  No Player shall be required to fill an Office without
      giving consent.  A Player indicates that e consents to fill an
      Office by posting to the Public Forum that e does so.  To be
      binding, such a post must be made not more than one week before,
      nor more than one week after, the time that the Player is
      designated to fill the Office in question.

      It is forbidden for two or more Players to hold the same Office
      at the same time.  If the Rules require that a specific Player
      fill an Office, any other Player who currently fills that Office
      ceases to do so simultaneously.

      place any other Player besides emself on Hold.  A Player may
      cease to be On Hold by sending a message indicating such to the
      Public Forum, so long as it has been at least 96 hours since e
      last went On Hold.  An Active Player is a Player who is not On
      Hold.

      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of em, including
      appointment as a Judge

      This rule takes precedence over any rule giving special duties
      to a particular player or a particular group of players.
