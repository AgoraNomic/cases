Caller's Arguments:

These NoV are valid; they are NoVs 59 and 60, respectively. I contest
them and initiate criminal CFJs from them; I suggest maximal penalties
as almost every one of the statements constitutes an individual
violation and is separately punishable.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by omd:

I contest both of these as the disclaimer clearly stated that some of
the actions might fail.

========================================================================

Judge Yally's Arguments:

Rule 2215 reads:

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement on a matter relevant
      to the rules unless e reasonably believes that it is true (or,
      in the case of a public statement that one performs an action,
      that it is thereby effective).

omd (comex) has made a plethora of public statements which e can not
reasonably believe are true. In this specific instance, it's
unreasonable to assume that omd thought that he had recently
registered or had been named as someone's mentor, or otherwise failed
any of the conditions required by Rule 1504 for guilt. Accordingly, I
judge omd to be GUILTY. Because omd did not seem to be cheating the
system or failing eir responsibilities, but rather simply being
obnoxious to the Herald, I sentence omd to COMMUNITY SERVICE. This
community service will consist of two tasks. The first is that omd
must apologize to Agora in writing using at least 200 words, six of
which must be the following prescribed words:
{{{
Herald
ribbon
scam
sorry
aeronautical
carper
}}}

and in this apology omd must explain eir error, shame, remorse, and
ardent desire for self-improvement. The second required task is that
omd must determine which of the following attempted actions:

> I award ais523 a Blue Ribbon.
> I award allispaul a Blue Ribbon.
> I award Andon a Blue Ribbon.
> I award comex a Blue Ribbon.
> I award coppro a Blue Ribbon.

actually succeeded and publicly announce eir findings.

========================================================================

Appellant omd's Arguments:

I appeal this.  Taking actions with disclaimers is a relatively common
practice, and has always been accepted as shorthand for specifying "If
possible, I do X" in the rest of the message.  Whether my succeeded in
doing anything might be ambiguous, though.  See the confused
progression of CFJs 1935 1971, 2069, and (especially) 2227.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Machiavelli:

So, what have we here? Let's take a look at the past cases and
determine what they established.

In CFJ 1935, Judge ais523 stated, "I can't see how [this] violates the
rules", implying that making a false allegation with a disclaimer is
legal.

In CFJ 1971, Gratuitous Arguer G. said that it's possible to take an
action with a disclaimer if and only if taking the action does not
require reporting any information. Judge ais523 agreed. It is not
clear whether the announcement made for a by-announcement action
counts as reporting.

In CFJ 2069, Judge ais523 judged that there are indeed game-relevant
actions in a certain disclaimed message, but eir ultimate reasoning
was that announcing the disclaimer was a game-relevant action. No
precedent is established here.

In CFJ 2227, Judge ais523 stated (though not as eir main reasoning)
that an action taken by self-consent (similar to announcement, but
more subtle, and, to my knowledge, only ever used in the rules once)
can be nullified by a disclaimer in the same message.

(CotC Murphy, I'm curious what your reasoning is for assigning H.
ais523 to all of these cases.)

So, there are two questions here: "Did omd effectively announce that e
awarded emself a White Ribbon?" and "Did e do so illegally?". On the
former question, the relevant CFJs are 1971, which does not establish
a clear precedent, and 2227, which establishes a weak precedent in
favor of discarding actions taken with disclaimers. A weak precedent
is stronger than no precedent; thus, in order to go with established
precedent, I believe that omd did not effectively announce these
awards, and thus, all of them failed. This makes the answer to the
latter question trivially "no".

However, Accused omd has stated, "Taking actions with disclaimers is a
relatively common practice, and has always been accepted as shorthand
for specifying 'If possible, I do X' in the rest of the message."
Before I actually judge this case, Accused omd is invited to cite a
CFJ supporting this statement.

========================================================================

Judge Machiavelli's Arguments:

I judge NOT GUILTY. I publish the following judicial declaration:
omd's message at 08/12/2010 12:31 PM, containing the sentence "I award
ais523 a Blue Ribbon.", did not award any Ribbons.
