Caller's Arguments:

Light arguments for TRUE: a list item is a type of paragraph, and there's
nothing else the term "paragraph that starts with '- Gardens'" could refer
to. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gratuitous Arguments by Jason:

I believe we've generally held that list items are either parts of
paragraphs or a separate thing, rather than being paragraphs themselves
(even if formatted as such). Also, "it can't possibly mean anything
else" isn't enough, given that we've rejected things like "Amend Rule
NNNN/R", even though that couldn't possibly mean anything else.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

CFJ 3778 found that list items could have whole line breaks inserted
between them and removed because they were not significant.  This is
not true with paragraphs.  If the section of text with ' - Gardens" is
taken to begin a paragraph, and is followed by additional list items
where the whitespace could be removed, the replaced paragraph would
include all of those line items.  Or at least it is unclear where the
paragraph ends.

Additional CFJ to consider -  In CFJ 3451, Judge Tiger explicitly
finds that the R105 standard is even stricter than "everyone knows
what was meant and there's only one reasonable interpretation" (maybe
R105 should be weakened a tad, but that would be a legislative not
judicial correction):

Judge ais523's Arguments:

This CFJ basically comes down to whether rule 2675 contained "[a]
paragraph that starts with '- Gardens'". If it doesn't, then the
instruction in the proposal is impossible to follow and therefore its
replacement couldn't have been required.

It's clear that the rule in question contained a *list item* that
started with "- Gardens", so the question basically boils down to
whether a list item is a paragraph. This is a distinction that has been
causing trouble for rich text engines / markup languages for some time;
the issue is primarily that there are some situations in English for
which a list item clearly isn't a paragraph (such as when a single
sentence continues across multiple paragraphs). There are also
situations in English where list items need to be considered paragraphs
for consistency (it is possible to have a list for which some of the
items consist of multiple paragraphs; in this case, the remaining items
would typically be considered to be single paragraphs). It's worth
noting that markup languages normally make explicit distinctions
between the two cases, and even render them differently; for example,
the CommonMark specification (https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#loose)
specifically defines "loose" lists where the elements contain
paragraphs versus "tight" lists that don't, and HTML allows for
different markup in the two cases (see the attached demo) – this is
evidence that these are real distinctions that actually exist in the
natural-language English, because markup languages would be unlikely to
go to the trouble of trying to capture this sort of distinction unless
doing so were required to perform their job of reflecting the structure
of written text.

The list in question has no clues that would help us distinguish
between the two cases here (other than the double-spacing between the
list elements, which suggests paragraphing but is not a sure indicator,
and might or might not be relevant under rule 2429). Instead of
resolving this problem immediately, I consider a subtle distinction
that exists in the "the list contains paragraphs" interpretation,
between "each list item is a paragraph" and "each list item contains a
single paragraph". This makes a difference because in addition to text,
the list contains bullet points (here a "-" marker) that mark the list
items, and the distinction affects whether the bullet point is part of
the paragraph or not; in the latter case, the bullet point serves to
mark where the list item starts, and the paragraph starts after that.
And the latter case seems to make a lot more sense here: if a list item
contained two paragraphs, the bullet point clearly wouldn't be part of
the second, so it would be inconsistent to consider it part of the
first (except if ruling paragraphs to be defined entirely by the line
breaks within the rule's text and ignoring its structure, which would
be inconsistent with previous precedent, e.g. CFJs 3452 and 3778).

This means that for the purpose of this CFJ, it doesn't matter whether
the list is considered to contain paragraphs or not; if the list item
in question contains a paragraph, then that paragraph starts with
"Gardens" (as opposed to starting with "- Gardens"). If the list is
considered to be a paragraph on its own, it starts with "- Wandering"
(or "The following is" if it's part of the same paragraph as its
introductory text). So in neither case does the proposal successfully
identify the text to replace.

One other point that needs considering is: is this an "inconsequential
variation in the quotation of an existing rule" (i.e. can we consider
the replacement as replacing a paragraph starting with "Gardens",
misquoted as "- Gardens")? If it is, it would be a special case which
rule 105 does not consider to be an ambiguity. However, in the case
that this CFJ is considering, the variation does not seem to be
sufficiently inconsequential: not only is there ambiguity around
whether the list is formed of paragraphs or not (which is not a
variation in quotation), it would affect whether the post-replacement
list item started with one bullet point or two (because even if rule
105 considers the bullet point in the *text to replace* to be
inconsequential, no such allowance is made for the *replacement text*,
so the first bullet point in the proposal gets ignored but the second
one doesn't; a difference between the expected and actual results of
the proposal that defies common sense to this extent would be
considerably consequential).

I judge CFJ 4010 FALSE.
