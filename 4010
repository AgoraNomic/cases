Caller's Arguments:

Light arguments for TRUE: a list item is a type of paragraph, and there's
nothing else the term "paragraph that starts with '- Gardens'" could refer
to. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gratuitous Arguments by Jason:

I believe we've generally held that list items are either parts of
paragraphs or a separate thing, rather than being paragraphs themselves
(even if formatted as such). Also, "it can't possibly mean anything
else" isn't enough, given that we've rejected things like "Amend Rule
NNNN/R", even though that couldn't possibly mean anything else.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

CFJ 3778 found that list items could have whole line breaks inserted
between them and removed because they were not significant.  This is
not true with paragraphs.  If the section of text with ' - Gardens" is
taken to begin a paragraph, and is followed by additional list items
where the whitespace could be removed, the replaced paragraph would
include all of those line items.  Or at least it is unclear where the
paragraph ends.

Additional CFJ to consider -  In CFJ 3451, Judge Tiger explicitly
finds that the R105 standard is even stricter than "everyone knows
what was meant and there's only one reasonable interpretation" (maybe
R105 should be weakened a tad, but that would be a legislative not
judicial correction):
