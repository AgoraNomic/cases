Judge scshunt's Arguments:

First, it seems clear that Murphy is indeed GUILTY. However, the only
thing e has to report on is Speed, which hasn't changed in months.

Therefore I sentence COMMUNITY SERVICE { Submit two proposals with
alternative ways of remedying the disproportionality between the
frequency with which Speed is changed, and the frequency with which it
must be reported, ensuring that if both are adopted, the result is
consistent. }
