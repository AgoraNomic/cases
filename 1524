Caller's Arguments:

The Deck was randomly and uniformly shuffled (algorithm
available, but it involved Heisenberg Uncertainty as described
in http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/ , so it better darn well
satisfy R1079).

Cards were dealt from the "top" of the deck, to those who
had drawn cards before the shuffle, in:
http://www.agoranomic.org/pipermail/agora-business/2004-November/003318.html
leaving a randomly-selected card on the "top" of the deck.
Note that the order of satisfying Player draws was determined
by me before the random shuffling process.

root then drew a card.  I attempted to deal the "randomly
placed" top card to root.  So did this satisfy the requirement
for a random deal contained in R2069?

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

R1079/3:
Rule 1079/3 (Power=1)
Definition of "Random"

       (a) When a Rule requires a random choice to be made, then the
           choice shall be made using whatever probability distribution
           among the possible outcomes the Rules provide for making
           that choice. If the Rules do not specify a probability
           distribution, then a uniform probability distribution shall
           be used.

       (b) Where the Rules do not indicate who is required to make a
           particular random choice, it shall be made by the Speaker.

       (c) When making a random choice as required by the Rules, a
           Player may rely on any physical or computational process
           whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes
           is reasonably close to that required by the Rules.

       (d) For the purposes of this Rule, tossing a platonic solid or
           coin that is not specially weighted has a probability
           distribution among the possible outcomes that is reasonably
           close to uniform.

       (e) For other methods, the Courts are the final arbiter of
           whether a method's probability distribution among the
           possible outcomes is reasonably close to that required by
           the Rules.


>From R2069/0:
      When a Gambler Draws a Card, the Deckmastor shall be
      required to randomly select one Card from among those
      currently in The Deck's Hand and transfer it to that Gambler
      as soon as possible. Until this transfer takes place, that
      Gambler is said to have one Pending Draw for each such
      transfer the Deckmastor is required to make, but has not yet
      made.

========================================================================

Judge Maud's Arguments:

I thank the Caller, Goethe, for providing arguments and evidence.  Too
often these are omitted.

A search of the rules reveals that cards in the Deck have no natural
order.  The shuffling of the Deck performed by the Deckmastor amounts to
making random choices of which cards to deal.  Rule 2069 requires the
Deckmastor to select a random card when (that is, as soon as possible
after) a Gambler draws.  This rule regulates dealing from the deck;
consequently, the Deckmastor may not select a random card to deal before
a Gambler actually draws.  Eir posting of the shuffled deck is analogous
to making a pledge to deal cards in the order listed.

Any card dealt to satisfy a draw made after the shuffled Deck was posted
was not selected randomly *after the draw*, as required by Rule 2069, and
therefore was dealt illegally.

I therefore find that a Corporate Bankruptcy card has not been legally
dealt to root, and so judge CFJ 1524 FALSE.
