Caller's Arguments:

I recently abused the naming rules to define a contract
defining VP as a currency that I can create by announcement, and used
it to escape from the VM.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Wooble:

the new contract was not the backing document for VP, as
they would continue to exist if the new contract didn't exist, thus it
couldn't grant the power to create VP.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by ehird:

The same could be said about the Vote Market at that time.

========================================================================

Judge Wooble's Arguments:

R2166 reads, in part:
     An asset is an entity defined as such by a rule or contract
     (hereafter its backing document), and existing solely because
     its backing document defines its existence.

Two parts of this are relevant to this case. First, the rule uses the
singular "a rule or contract"; an asset can have on a single backing
document.  Second, an asset must exist solely because its backing
document defines its existence.  This strengthens the first point; if
two contracts define something, it would continue to be defined if
either of the contracts ceased to exist and thus could not be an
asset.

Before the actions to which this case pertains, Vote Points
unambiguously were defined only by the Vote Market agreement, which
was their backing document. If ehird's pledge could also define Vote
Points at the same time the Vote Market did so, Vote Points would
cease to be an asset under Rule 2166.

Rule 1586 says, in part:
     If multiple rules or contracts (hereafter documents) attempt to
     define an entity with the same name, then they refer to the same
     entity.

Thus, ehird's pledge's attempt to define Vote Points succeeding in
doing so and referred to the same entity the Vote Market did.

Now, the question is whether ehird's pledge makes it so e CAN create
Vote-Points-the-non-asset-entity, and if so, whether those Vote Points
became Vote-Points-the-Asset when the pledge was terminated.

Since at the time the contract existed Vote Points were not an Asset,
R2166's grant of the ability of a Recordkeepor to generally create
assets does not apply.  No other rule specifically allows the creation
of a Vote Point entity, so their creation is legal if and only if it's
an unregulated action.  Rule 2125(e) says that an action that would,
as part of its effect, modify information for which some player is
required to be recordkeepor is impossible except as allowed by other
rules.  While the instantaneous creation of contract state in ehird's
contract of the existence of 1000 VP in eir possession does not, at
the time it happens, create any recordkeeping obligation (since only
recordkeepors of assets have such an obligation), the subsequent
(otherwise legal) action of terminating the pledge CANNOT modify
any information for which BobTHJ is required to act as recordkeepor.
The continuity of the 1000 VPs granted by R1586 thus conflicts with
R2125, and R2125 takes precedence by means of having a higher power.
