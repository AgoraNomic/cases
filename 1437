==============================  CFJ 1437  ==============================

    Where the Bank has been properly ordered to forgive a debt
    denominated in a Bank Currency, only the Treasuror is both permitted
    and required to act on the Bank's behalf to forgive the debt.

Caller's Arguments:

I'll begin by showing that Bank Currency Recordkeepors are neither
permitted nor required to forgive the Bank's debts, and then show that
the Treasuror is both permittec and required to do so.

In general, Limited Executors are permitted to do only those things that
the Rules explicitly permit them to do on behalf of their Executees
(R1478(b)).

Each Bank Currency Recordkeepor is a Limited Executor of the Bank with
respect to that Currency, but is empowered only to make transfers of
that Currency from the Bank (R1470(b)), not to forgive debts. Hence Bank
Currency Recordkeepors are not permitted to forgive the Bank's debts.

In general, the Prime Executor of an entity with respect to a certain
action is the player who is responsible for performing that action
(R1989(a)).

Each Bank Currency Recordkeepor is the Prime Executor of the Bank with
respect to debts denominated in that Currency (R1470(c)). But a debt is
defined as an obligation to pay (R1596(a)). Hence Bank Currency
Recordkeepors are responsible only for satisfying the Bank's obligations
to pay, not its obligations to forgive.

Finally, the Treasuror is the Executor of the Bank, and is therefore
empowered to perform all actions that the Bank is permitted to perform
(R1478(a)), which includes forgiving debts pursuant to a properly issued
Order (R1470(e)). The Treasuror is also the Prime Executor of the Bank
with respect to all "other" actions -- ie all actions other than
satisfying the bank's debts -- that the Bank is required to perform
(R1470(c)).

Judge Sherlock's Arguments:

As noted above, R1478 states:

      (b) A Limited Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered
          by the Rules to perform on behalf of that entity a subset of
          the actions which the Rules permit the entity to perform. A
          Limited Executor is permitted to perform on behalf of an
          Executee only such actions as are explicitly permitted by
          the Rules.

and R1470 states:

      (b) The Treasuror is the Executor of the Bank.  Each
          Recordkeepor of each Bank Currency is a Limited Executor of
          the Bank, and is empowered to make transfers of that
          Currency from the Bank.

      (c) Each Recordkeepor of each Bank Currency is the Prime
          Executor of the Bank with respect to debts denominated in
          that Currency. The Treasuror is the Prime Executor of the
          Bank with respect to all other actions that the Bank is
          required to perform.

R1470 says that a Recordkeepor is "empowered to make transfers of that
currency from the Bank."  No other rights or duties are "explictly
permitted by the Rules" per R1478.  While a Recordkeepor "is the Prime
Executor of the Bank with respect to debts," if there is an understanding
that that would include forgiving as well as making transfers, that
understanding would have to be considered implicit, not explicit.
Therefore it seems reasonable that Recordkeepors are not allowed to
forgive debts.

So, is the Treasuror "permitted" and "required" to forgive debts?  Well,
the Treasuror is clearly permitted to forgive the debt, since that would
have to fall under the category of "other actions" than transference of
currency.  As for the requirement of forgiving debts, see R1989:

      (a) The Prime Executor of an entity with respect to a certain
          action is the Player who is responsible for performing that
          action. For each action that an entity is required to
          perform, there shall be at most one Prime Executor of that
          entity with respect to that action. Any penalty incurred due
          to an entity's failure to perform as required by the Rules
          is incurred by the Prime Executor of that entity.

It seems that if the Bank is properly ordered to do something, it can be
reasonably surmised that it is "required" to do so.  Therefore, the Prime
Executor (in this case, the Treasuror) is, as a result, "required" to do
it as well.
