Caller's Arguments:

Per Rule 2525, pending a proposal whose sole effect is to destroy a
contract a protected action, and therefore cannot be forbidden by a
contract. Thus, the restriction on pending proposals in "No
Self-Indulgence" does not apply to any proposal whose sole effect is to
destroy a contract.

If it is LEGAL for me to pend Self-Indulgence, then it will repeal Rule
101. In this case, its effect is not solely limited to destroying a
contract (or any of the other effects that would cause its pending to be
protected by Rule 2525). Thus, pending it is unprotected and No
Self-Indulgence is free to restrict it. So it must actually be ILLEGAL.

If it is ILLEGAL for me to pend Self-Indulgence, then it will not repeal
Rule 101. In this case, its effect is solely limited to destroying a
contract, and pending it is protected. Thus No Self-Indulgence cannot
impose on me an obligation not to pend it, so it must be LEGAL (Given that,
as is in fact the case, there is nothing else that would make it illegal).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge G.'s Arguments:

This is the first case being judged where PARADOXICAL is potentially
appropriate as a judgement (Proposal 7976 adopted November 26).  As
such, there are some ground rules to consider.  In particular, when
paradox was previously part of win conditions, the apparent ability of
contracts to create arbitrary/circular text led to an explosion of
paradox attempts.  It's important, as a matter of precedent going
forward, to consider contracts as "natural agreements" to work in a
straightforward manner within a body of law, and apply very strict
scrutiny to attempts to set up paradoxes, by asking whether the rules
explicitly enable the paradox (this is a note to future judges of
potentially PARADOXICAL cases).

Ok, with that statement of judicial bias in mind, the facts. This case
hinges on what the "effects" of a proposal are, for the purposes of this
clause of R2525:
>      The following are protected actions:
>      [...]
>      2. Submitting, pending, or voting freely on a proposal, but only

So we need to ask:  what are the "effects" of a proposal, from which
we can identify a "sole" effect? 

It's possible to be highly pedantic and say "every character of a
proposal has a game effect", because it would affect the outcome of a
later CFJ "Does Proposal N contain text Z"?  But this doesn't satisfy.
The appropriate legal question is:  Is it IRRELEVANT that the proposal
contained a specific body of text, at the time the Proposal as a whole
takes effect?  If so, the text didn't have an effect.

To this end, []-delimited comments are a good example.  The test is, if
you could replace the text in the [] with any arbitrary text, would it
change an outcome?  In general, for clearly-delimited comments, no. So
to set that limit:  comment text has no game effect (other than the
aforementioned trivial, after-the-fact CFJ). So in general, the test is:
if a part of the proposal text could be replaced with other arbitrary
text without changing the results when it takes effect, that text has no
"effect" for R2525 purposes.

So, what about a conditional clause?  It's important to note that,
while we've judged conditionals on "by announcement" actions to be
informal conveniences without the weight of law, this is not true for
conditionals within Proposals.  As instruments, any contained
conditionals should be evaluated similarly to conditionals contained in
the rules, and if their evaluation leads to a paradox, it doesn't
outright nullify the action (the way it would for a conditional on a
by-announcement action), so ambiguity/paradox alone doesn't stop the
conditional from (potentially) having an effect.

It helps to look at a non-paradoxical case.  What if the clause is
simply "If FALSE, then Y"?  Since we can trivially evaluate the
conditional clause as FALSE, we can use lazy evaluation of clause Y and
ignore it (not evaluate it).  It doesn't matter what Y says, as long as
the conditional is FALSE, then Y can be any text without game effect.

So if a conditional clause is FALSE, the following clause Y has no game
effect, as the Caller states.

But what about the conditional clause itself?  Could we change it?  No!
Obviously, if we changed "if FALSE" to "if TRUE", then the following
clause Y would have game effect.  Which means that, whether FALSE, TRUE,
or indeterminate, the conditional clause itself has the formal game
effect of telling us whether to evaluate Y for game effect.

Therefore, regardless of the truth value of the conditional clause
(including if its truth value is indeterminate), its very existence
instructs us to evaluate whether the following clause has an effect, so
the conditional clause itself has a game effect.

Therefore, the proposal does not have the "sole effect" of modifying a
contract, regardless of the truth of its conditional clause.  So it was
possible for the Contract to forbid pending it, and it was ILLEGAL for
Alexis to pend it.  I find this CFJ to be FALSE.
