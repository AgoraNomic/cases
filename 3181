Gratuitous Arguments by ehird:

in the context of the full message, the intent
is clearly for the Slave Golem to choose a confusing name and then
deregister. True, whitespace is irrelevant, but even collapsing the
whitespace, the message naturally reads as the intended
interpretation, and makes no sense at all with the unintended one.
Additionally, for quoting tricky sections (including punctuation,
etc.), it is Agoran custom to use more solid enclosures like {}.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Evidence by ehird:

[CotC: quoting omd]

I cause Mr. Incredible to change his name to '.

I cause ' to deregister.  [thus destroying it; Rule 2361's first
sentence arguably enforces that Slave Golems are always players, but
both Rule 869 and the right to deregister take precedence]

Now you can't get me because selecting a confusing nickname is not
defined as a Crime, and you can't get em because e's been destroyed.
Neener neener.

========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

I judge CFJs 3180 and 3181 technically MALFORMED, as the sequence of
characters given as the CFJ "statement" can't be parsed as a statement,
being nonsensical when interpreted as English and not meaningful in
other natural languages I know.

In spirit, they're FALSE; the lexing of the ambiguous statement where
Mr. Incredible was doing that doesn't make sense. In general, if there's
two different reasonable ways to tokenise a statement, the presumption
is that it's intended to tokenise via the method that parses correctly.
