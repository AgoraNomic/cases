==============================  CFJ 2643  ==============================

    It is generally POSSIBLE, if allowed by Rule 2264, to act on behalf
    of a player to deregister by announcement.

History:

Called by omd:                          30 Jul 2009 20:38:50 GMT
Assigned to Murphy:                     31 Jul 2009 00:31:25 GMT
Judged TRUE by Murphy:                  31 Jul 2009 00:41:54 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

If "equivalent" means having the same effect, then acting on behalf of
a person to send a message has the same effect as sending the message,
but the message is not actually sent.  Rule 478, which takes
precedence over the a.o.b. rules, requires an announcement to be
contained in a public message.  Rule 2263 would still make the
deregistration POSSIBLE so I believe the outcome should be TRUE/FALSE.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 2263:

      Acting on behalf of (syn. send messages on behalf of) a person
      (the grantor) with a specified message is equivalent to sending
      a public message authored by the grantor.

Rule 478:

      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent
      to all players and containing a clear designation of intent to
      be public.  A person "publishes" or "announces" something by
      sending a public message.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

Per R2263, acting on behalf of a person creates the legal fiction that
that person sent a message.  R2263 has power equal to R478, and R478
does not explicitly attempt to ignore legal fictions, so R2263 works
as intended.
