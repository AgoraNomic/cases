Judge Syllepsis's Arguments:

Rule 1729 states that, "Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to
Assessor." Therefore, if casting a Vote on behalf of a Group is considered
to be the Vizier Voting, the Vizier has then "bended" Rule 1729. Given the
poetic nature of Rule 1729, it is safe to interpret "bended" as "broken".

By Rule 766, the Vizier is Executor of the Group. Rule 1478 States that,
"The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the Rules to
act on behalf of that entity, as if e were that entity."

By acting on behalf of the Group, e acts as the agent of the
Group. However, this action is performed as if e were the Group. Thus when
the Vizier Votes on behalf of the Group, as Executor of the Group, e is
considered to be the Group.

Therefore, when the Vizier Votes on behalf of the Group, e is a Group
Voting, and by the wording of Rule 1729, a Group does not violate insanity
by Voting in Public.

Furthermore, it should be noted that as the prevailing mode of voting is
Public, a Group Vote is not affected by Rule 1729 and should therefore NOT
be sent privately to the Assessor but to a Public Forum in order to count.

Judge Syllepsis's Evidence:

Rule 766/15 (Power=1)
Groups

      A Group is an Organization with an associated SLC called its
      Ordinances. The Administrator for each Group is that Group's
      Ordinancekeepor, the Executor is its Vizier, and the set of
      Players within the Jurisdiction of its SLC is its Membership.

      A Group's Membership may contain any Player who is not a Member
      of any other Group. Initially, the Group's Membership must
      contain at least three Foundors. The Ordinancekeepor and the
      Vizier of a Group must, at all times, be Members of the Group;
      if either ceases to be a Member of the Group, it dissolves.

      Each Group has Mint Authority.

      A Group's Voting Power on a Democratic Proposal is as follows:

        (a) A Group containing fewer than three members: zero;
        (b) A Group containing at least three members: the number of
            Players divided by the number of Groups with at least
            three members, rounded down.


Rule 1478/4 (Power=1)
Executors

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e were that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      Only a person or an entity with a Player Executor may perform
      actions.

Rule 1729/3 (Power=1)
Insanity

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      And should such a Proposal's Voting Period begin,
      but no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

CFJ 1178, Judged TRUE Nov. 18 1999: "Rule 1729 permits voting on
Insane Proposals by private message to the Assessor, even when the
prevailing mode of voting on Proposals is Public."
