    Proposal 5373 was adopted in Message-ID:
    <476D30DB.6040804@socal.rr.com>

History:

Called by Murphy:                       22 Dec 2007 17:58:26 GMT
Assigned to OscarMeyr:                  22 Dec 2007 18:24:52 GMT
Judged TRUE by OscarMeyr:               10 Jan 2008 00:01:21 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

The message in question contained all the usual indicators of adoption,
including "Text of adopted proposals:" followed by a copy of the
proposal, except that no shorthand mark from the following list:
  ADOPTED (*), REJECTED (x), and FAILED QUORUM (!)
was included.

This is distinct from past errors in which a blank space was used as
shorthand for REJECTED, and thus the accidental omission of * caused
adoption to be unsuccessful due to self-contradiction.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

Some of the precedent in CFJ 1810 applies to this case.  In CFJ 1810, required
information was included by reference to a prior report.  In this case, H.
Assessor Murphy inadvertently omitted from the report in question an explicit
specification of which option Agora selected in a decision.  However, the
publication of the text of Prop. 5373 in the section "Text of adopted
proposals" is consistent with Agora's customary treatment of adopted
proposals.  I consider this to be adequately clear to overcome the minor
omission, as per the precedent in CFJ 1810.  I therefore rule TRUE.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Evidence:

1.  Rule 208/5 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision may resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the option selected by Agora.  E
      SHALL do so as soon as possible after the end of the voting
      period.  To be valid, this announcement must satisfy the
      following conditions:

      (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

      (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      (c) It specifies which option was selected by Agora, as
          described elsewhere, and provides a tally of the voters'
          valid ballots on the various options.

      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

2.  H. Trial Judge Eris's arguments in CFJ 1810:

The message in question does provide the necessary information to meet
the standard I set in CFJ 1711. Although it is preferable to have a
full and complete record in one message, this is not required by the
Rules, so this kind of criterion must be evaluated on a case by case
basis. In this case, the record shows a report, a minor objection, and
a correction properly suited to the degree of the objection that
refers to the original report in a clear manner.
