Caller's Arguments:

The issue here is about how much evidence needs to be given
for act-on-behalf to work. Contracts can generally use their own
definitions; but what about private parts of public contracts?
Certainly, if this works, it shouldn't be able to.

But what if I protest? Does the action happen anyway? If not, then
there's no point in putting the act-on-behalf clause in the contract;
just put in a SHALL, as it comes to the same thing anyway.

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

If the alleged grantee is obviously paying attention to the
game and doesn't protest that it fails, our current custom is to prima
facie assume that it works [CFJ 1290 is relevant in cases where a game-
participating grantee is pointedly silent].  This doesn't seem particularly
dangerous, if we allow private contracts in the first place we are
allowing all kinds of private dealings like this, and we really can't stop
or detect problems in any of them unless a party protests, we pretty much
have to take at face value that if two parties show that a private
understanding was reached, it was.   -G.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by ais523:

It does not make much sense for secret information to have
effects on platonic gamestate; it is a lot more sensible for private
contracts to be limited to affecting the results of court cases
concerning them indirectly. Breach of a private contract can be
punished; that's enough to make private contracts useful. Also, putting
the onus on a party protesting is very dangerous; they might not be
aware that the action had happened. (At least one non-player is party to
a contract, for instance.) With a public contract, everyone can see for
emself that the action is legal; with a private contract, there is a
huge onus on the parties. (Also, consider private contracts with a
secrecy clause, such as the (possibly defunct) UNDEAD. Suppose one
player acts on behalf of another claiming that a secret contract (which
the second is party to, but the first isn't) allows them to. The second
player cannot then object without revealing information that e is
contractually obligated to keep secret. This gives a rather simple and
efficient method of busting the secrecy of such contracts; object, or be
enslaved.)
