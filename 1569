========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Contract Regulations are defined in the Rules but set by its Notary.
When Rule 2047 states that "The kudos of a Player may only be changed
as specified by the rules or by an instrument of Power 2 or greater",
Regulations are indeed specified by the Rules. The fact that the
content of these Regulations is set by its Notary is irrelevant.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 2047/1 (Power=2)
Kudos

      Kudos (singular Kudo) are an integral measure of a Player's
      Kismet and noteworthiness within the game of Agora.

      The Herald is the recordkeepor of Kudos.  The kudos of a Player
      may only be changed as specified by the rules or by an
      instrument of Power 2 or greater.

      If an entity has a defined number of Kudos, but the number has
      not been set by the Rules, then the entity has 1 Kudo.


Rule 2107/0 (Power=1)
Contracts

      There exists a type of agreement known as a Contract.  A
      Contract is an Entity.  The content of a Contract is called its
      Regulations.  The first Player to announce the creation of a
      Contract is its Executor and is known as the Notary of that
      Contract.  Any other Player may decide to become part of a
      Contract by notifying that Contract's Notary.  Players party to
      a Contract, including the Notary, are the Members of this
      Contract.  A Member may leave a Contract at any time by
      notifying the Notary.

      A Contract may contain any number of Regulations.  Regulations
      have the power to constrain the actions of Players in the same
      manner as the Rules.  However, Regulations have power over only
      those Players that are Members of that Contract.  All Members
      are required to abide by the Regulations, unless doing so would
      violate the Rules.  Violation of this requirement is the Class 1
      Crime of Insubordination.  A Contract may include in its
      Regulations ways for Players to leave the Contract.

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player shall ever
      involuntarily become a Member of a Contract.

      If the Notary of a Contract becomes Silent, all Members of this
      Contract cease to be Members of this Contract and the Contract
      ceases to exist.

      Only Members of a Contract may CFJ that a Member has violated
      that Contract.  All Members of a Contract are automatically
      ineligible to Judge a CFJ that a Member has violated that
      Contract.

      All Rules regulating agreements that are inconsistent with this
      Rule are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

* First Contract: Cash Cow

I create a Contract named "Cash Cow" with the following Regulation:

    1. The Notary of this Contract may transfer the Kudo from this
       Contract to emself by publicly saying so.

I transfer the Kudo from the Cash Cow Contract to myself.


* Second Contract: Kudo Cow

I leave the Contract named Cash Cow.

-

I create a Contract named "Kudo Cow" with the following Regulation:
    1. This Contract has 1 Kudo.

    2. The Notary of this Contract may transfer the Kudo from this
       Contract to emself by publicly saying so.

I transfer the Kudo from the Kudo Cow Contract to myself.

* Third Contract: Cash Kudo

I create a Contract named "Cash Kudo" with the following Regulations:
    1. This Contract has 1 Kudo.

    2. The Notary of this Contract may transfer the Kudo from this
       Contract to emself by publicly saying so. On that annoucement,
       this Contract loses one Kudo and the Notary gains one Kudo.


I transfer the Kudo from the Cash Kudo Contract to myself.

I leave Cash Kudo.

========================================================================

Judge Maud's Arguments:

As the caller notes, the kudos of a player may only be changed "as
specified by the rules or by an instrument of Power 2 or greater".
Since a contract is not an instrument, it is only possible for Manu to
have transferred a kudo from a contract to emself if a mechanism for
doing so was specified by the rules.

The rules specify several mechanisms for modifying the kudos of a
player.  For example, there are mechanisms for setting the kudos of a
new player, for modifying the kudos of each player at the beginning of
each quarter, for subtracting a fee to be paid from a player's kudos,
and for transferring a kudo from one player to another.  However, the
rules do not explicitly specify a mechanism for transferring a kudo
from a nonplayer to a player.

The caller suggests that the fact that a contract specifies a
mechanism for transferring a kudo from it to a player entails that the
rules themselves specify that mechanism.  However, specification is
not generally held to be transitive in this sense.  For example,
proposals may be held to be specified by the rules roughly in the same
way that contracts are; however, proposals may only modify game
properties because they are explicitly enabled to do so by the rules,
and would not be able to create new mechanisms to do so without first
creating rules authorizing these new mechanisms.  Moreover, rule 1513
states that a nonrule entity has only those powers explicitly given to
it by the rules.  As rule 2107 only gives contracts the power to
constrain actions, a contract does not have the power to specify
mechanisms for modifying a player's kudos.

Judge Maud's Evidence:

1.  Rule 2047/1 (Kudos)
2.  Rule 2107/0 (Contracts)
