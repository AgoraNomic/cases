Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1887 states:
      (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
          there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 72 hours have
          passed without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid
          (at the time the Bid is made) having been made. The Auction
          shall end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has
          not ended earlier.

More than 72 hours passed between Goethe's Bid of 175 (which wasn't the
high Bid, anyway) and Lindrum's message; under any interpretation of the
Rule, the high Bid was certainly no later than Goethe's, as no Bids took
place then, so the Auction ended before Lindrum's message.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1887/9 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Auctions

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      (a) Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is responsible for collecting
          bids and announcing the result of the Auction. Unless
          otherwise specified, the Speaker shall be the Auctioneer.

      (b) Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction. On
          Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir Bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one
          particular currency. The Rule requiring a particular
          Auction must specify the currency to be used, or the
          Auction cannot take place.

      (d) Number of Items: Each Auction is conducted for 1 or more
          identical items. Throughout this Rule, N indicates the
          number of items up for bid in the Auction.

      (e) Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the first
          correct and legal announcement that an Auction is begun, as
          defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public Forum,
          together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the Auction
          Currency, the number of items, and the value of the
          Starting Bid.

      (f) Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
          value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Starting
          Bid is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (g) Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
          during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
          Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that
          particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is
          only valid if it satisfies the following conditions:
          (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the Auction, or
              after its end.
          (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the Auction
              Currency.
          (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.

      (h) Canceling Bids: A Bid may be cancelled by its Bidder by
          posting such to the Public Forum, clearly identifying the
          Bid to be cancelled, while the Auction is in progress.

      (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
          there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 72 hours have
          passed without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid
          (at the time the Bid is made) having been made. The Auction
          shall end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has
          not ended earlier.

      (j) Winning Bids: When the Auction ends, the winning Bids are
          the N largest uncancelled valid Bids in that auction (or
          all valid uncancelled Bids, if there were less than N valid
          uncancelled Bids). Ties shall be broken in favor of earlier-
          submitted bids.

          The Final Auction Price is:
          (1) The amount of the Nth highest Bid, if there were N or
              more valid uncancelled Bids in the auction;
          (2) The Starting Bid, if there were fewer than N valid
              uncancelled Bids.

          At the end of the Auction, each winner bidder incurs a debt
          for each of eir winning bids. As soon as possible after the
          end of the Auction, the Auctioneer shall announce the
          winning Bids and issue to each winning Bidder a separate
          bill for each of eir winning Bids.

          Unless specified otherwise, the Auctioneer shall transfer an
          Auctioned item to the winning Bidder as soon as possible
          after the bill for that item is paid.
