Judge G.'s Arguments:

In general, contracts only have the exact abilities the rules say they
have, no more. In particular, statements/interpretations of contracts
are generally subject to standards of textual clarity similar to
by-announcement actions. The standards (precedents over time)
generally hold that self-contradictory announcements or contract
clauses are simply failures to communicate, not paradox-makers. Rule
2682 makes "consenting to a rice plan" essentially synonymous with
having one's signature on it, so the contract in the Caller's evidence
reduces to a classic self-contradictory Russell's Paradox. Due to this
self-contradiction, the contract fails to "explicitly and
unambiguously" communicate any kind of consent as required by
R2519(2).  Further, while some "technically broken" contracts may
still provide some limited context for consent as per R2519(4),
creating "paradoxical consent" has been found to fail to meet R2519(4)
standards as per CFJ 4013:

Therefore, the contract in the Caller's evidence does not meet Agoran
standards for determining consent to anything.  FALSE.

Side-note: I believe the logic of this judgement holds whether or not
"consenting to rice plans" is judged (in currently-parallel CFJs) as
an instant action, a continual action, or if R2519 is used as
definitional guidance for consenting to a non-action.  So this
judgement should hold regardless of the outcome of those CFJs.

Judge's Evidence:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2519/2 (Power=3)
Consent

      A person is deemed to have consented to an action if and only if,
      at the time the action took place:

      1. e, acting as emself, has publicly stated that e agrees to the
         action and not subsequently publicly withdrawn eir statement;
      2. e is party to a contract whose body explicitly and
          unambiguously indicates eir consent;
      3. the action is taken as part of a promise which e created; or
      4. it is reasonably clear from context that e wanted the action to
         take place or assented to it taking place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2682/0 (Power=1)
The Rice Game

      The Ricemastor is an office, in charge of tracking Rice, Rice
      Plans and Signatures. Rice is a fixed asset, ownable only by
      players. Any active player can create a Rice Plan by announcement,
      if e hasn't done so yet in the current week. Rice Plans can have
      Signatures, and each Signature must be of an active player. A Rice
      Plan has an active player's Signature as long as that player is
      consenting to it. An active player can destroy a Rice Plan that e
      has created by announcement.

      A Harvest occurs at the beginning of each week. When this occurs:
      - If there is only one Rice Plan with the most Signatures, that
        Rice Plan is Harvested.
      - If there is more than one Rice Plan with the most Signatures,
        the one that was created earliest is Harvested.
      - In all other cases, nothing happens.
      And then all Rice Plans are destroyed and the Harvest ends.

      Rice Plans consist of two lists of players, with each list having
      no repeated players, and the lists can be empty. One of these
      lists is its Rice Up list, and the other is its Rice Down list.
      When a Rice Plan is Harvested, for each player listed in its Rice
      Up list, if that player is active, e gains 1 Rice; and for each
      player listed in its Rice Down list, if e has at least 1 Rice then
      e lose 1 Rice.

      If after a Harvest there is a single active player with at least 2
      Rice and more Rice than any other player, then that player wins
      the game, and all Rice is destroyed. When the game has been won in
      this manner three times, this rule repeals itself.
