======================================================================
Reasons and Arguments, caller:

  Rule 1617 states, in part,

     In any case, no Player shall ever be made part of the
     Jurisdiction of any Compact without eir consent.

  So the Statement is clearly true unless this paragraph of
  1617 is overridden by some higher-precedence Rule.  A
  Player has suggested that the language in Rule 1446,
  which says of Contests

      The Jurisdiction of a Contest is permitted to contain any Player.

  conflicts with 1617, and by virtue of a lower rule-number,
  takes precendece over it.

  This is, however, incorrect: the Rules are not in fact in
  conflict.  Rule 1446 merely grants permission; it says that
  there is nothing per se illegal about the Jurisdiction of
  a Contest being such as to contain any given Player.  It
  says nothing of mechanism; it would, for instance, be
  absurd to claim that the motion of the wind, or the waves
  of the sea, had, by Rule 1446, caused all Players with
  nicknames beginning with "R" to belong to all Contests.

  Rule 1446 is silent on the question of how a Player comes
  to be in the Jurisdiction of the Contest, clearly leaving
  that question up to other Rules.  One of the other Rules
  that addresses the question of mechanism is 1617, and it
  quite clearly prohibits any mechanism that would bring a
  Player into a Jurisdiction against eir will.

  While I think the Statement is quite clearly true, the
  fact that a dispute arose at all suggests that the wording
  of the Rules in question could be improved.



======================================================================
Decision of Judge elJefe:  TRUE

Rule 1011 (MI=2) says:

      No property of any entity shall be changed except in accordance
      with procedures specified by the Rules, when that entity
      possesses that property solely by the virtue of the Rules
      defining that property.

This Rule takes precedence over Rule 1446 (MI=1) and other rules
regarding Jurisdictions.  Therefore the Jurisdiction of a Compact 
may not be changed except by procedures specified by the Rules.

The rules which specify procedures for a player to become part of 
the Jurisdiction of a Compact are Rules 719, 766, 1446, 1455, 1533, 
and 1539, quoted below.

Rule 1612 says that a Compact's Jurisdiction can vary over the period of 
its existence, but does not itself specify any procedures for doing so.
Similarly, Rule 1446 asserts the ability of a Contest's Jurisdiction to 
contain any player, but fails to specify a procedure for doing so.

In each of the cases where a procedure is specified, becoming a part of
the Jurisdiction requires either consent of the Player (to become Contest-
master), or an explicit act of the player notifying the administrator and/or 
the Notary that one is joining the Jurisdiction, or that one is a Foundor 
(and therefore part of the original Jurisdiction).  Such notification 
constitutes consent.

I therefore find the statement TRUE, in that by Rule 1011 the only way for 
a Player to become part of the Jurisdiction of any of the current types of 
Organizations requires such notification.

Additional Evidence:

----------------------------------------

Rule 1011/2 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      No property of any entity shall be changed except in accordance
      with procedures specified by the Rules, when that entity
      possesses that property solely by the virtue of the Rules
      defining that property.

----------------------------------------

Rule 719/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Joining a Group

      A Player shall be added to the Membership of a Group only when:

      a) the Player to be added is not already a Member of another
         Group;
      b) the Player to be added has sent the Vizier of the Group in
         question a message requesting to be added to the Membership
         of that Group; and
      c) the addition of that Player to that Group's Membership is
         otherwise permitted by that Group's Ordinances and the Rules.

----------------------------------------

Rule 766/6 (Mutable, MI=1)
Groups

      A "Group" is an Organization of Class Group; this Class is a
      valid Class of Organization.

      All Groups are Public Organizations.  The Jurisdiction of a
      Group's Compact is permitted to contain any Player, but no
      Player is permitted to be part of the Jurisdictions of the
      Compacts of more than one Group simultaneously.

      Each Group shall possess exactly one Treasury.  

      A Group must have exactly three Foundors, who constitute the
      Group's initial Jurisdiction.  Both the Administrator and the
      Executor of a Group must be part of the Jurisdiction of that
      Group's Compact.

      The following definitions pertain to Groups:
      * Ordinances: a synonym for a Group's Compact.
      * Ordinancekeepor: a synonym for the Group's Administrator
      * Vizier: a synonym for the Group's Executor
      * Membership: the Jurisdiction of the Group's Compact.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1446/8 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      A "Contest" is an Organization of Class Contest; this Class is a
      valid Class of Organization.

      All Contests are Public Organizations.  The Jurisdiction of a
      Contest is permitted to contain any Player.  Each Contest shall
      possess exactly one Treasury.  The Executor of a Contest is, at
      all times, its Administrator.

      A Contest must have exactly one Foundor, who becomes the
      Contest's initial Administrator.

      The following definitions pertain to Contests:

      * Regulations: a synonym for a Contest's Compact.
      * Contestmaster: a synonym for a Contest's Administrator.
      * Contest Fund: a synonym for a Contest's Treasury.
      * Contestant: a Player who is part of a Contest's Jurisdiction,
        but who is not the Contest's Administrator.

      A Contest is created by distributing a copy of its initial 
      Regulations to the Public Forum, along with the Contest's
      Name, any provisions to the contrary in the default Organization 
      Rules notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1455/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contracts

      Let there be a class of Organization known as a Contract, whose
      Compact can also be referred to as a Contract.

      A Contract consists only of Warranties, which are known as its
      Terms, the Players within its Jurisdiction are known as the
      Parties to the Contract, and the Administrator for all Contracts
      is the Notary.

      Contracts do not possess Treasuries, nor do they possess
      Executors.

      Contracts have the legal force to impose penalties upon Parties
      that do not abide by the Terms of the Contract.  Parties that
      are unwilling or unable to abide by the Terms are said to be in
      Breach of the Contract.

      A Contract may specify the following:

        i) What actions the parties to the contract are required to
           perform, or are prohibited from performing, and under what
           conditions these requirements or prohibitions have force.
       ii) What penalties are imposed upon a party who Breaches the
           Contract.

      The Foundors of a Contract must be the set of all Parties to the
      Contract. In addition to what other Rules require them to
      provide to the Notary, the Foundors must also specify the
      following information:

       i) The identity of each Party to the Contract, each of whom
          must be named in the Terms of the Contract itself.

      Providing a unique Name for the Contract is optional, this takes
      precedence over the general requirements for information
      provided.  If no Name is provided, the Notary must provide a
      unique Name for the Contract and provide this Name to all
      Parties.  Parties can then change the Name as provided for in
      the Contract or in other Rules.

      A Contract is Private, and the Notary shall send a notification
      to all the Parties of a Contract As Soon As Possible after it
      has been legally  entered into.  The Contract shall be in force
      no sooner than the moment of that notification.

      A Contract ceases to have force at the moment it is dissolved in
      accordance with its Terms, or one or more of the Parties of the
      Contract ceases to  be a Player, or the Contract is breached as
      described elsewhere.

      When a Contract is changed (including any change in the Parties) a
      current Party to the Contract must inform the Notary of the
      change as soon as possible after it occurs.  If a Party is being
      added to, or removed from, the Contract, the change only has
      effect if _that_ Party sends the notification.  The Notary shall
      forward this notification of change to all current Parties of
      the Contract As Soon As Possible thereafter.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1533/4 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creation of Organizations, and Their Compacts

      Any Player is permitted to submit to the Notary, at any time, an
      Application to Create an Organization.  Such an Application, to
      have legal effect, must specify the proposed class, name, and
      Compact of the prospective Organization, along with any other
      information that is required in order to create an Organization
      of the class specified.

      If, within a period of seven days, the Notary receives identical
      Applications to Create an Organization from as many distinct
      Players as required by the Rules pertaining to the class of the
      Organization to be created, the Organization is created.  The
      Players who submitted the Applications in question are known as
      the Foundors of the new Organization.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1539/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Regulations and Membership of Contests

      A Contest's Regulations consist only of Statutes, any one of
      which is referred to as a Regulation. No Player within
      Jurisdiction of a Contest's Regulations is bound by a Regulation
      or combination of Regulations that conflict with the Rules.

      The Regulations can specify the following:

        i) How a Contestmaster is replaced. No person may become
           Contestmaster without eir consent.  If left unspecified,
           the Contestmaster cannot change while the Contest exists.
       ii) How the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent.  If
           this is not specified, they may only be spent when the
           Rules require it.
      iii) The amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of any specific Currency.
       iv) Additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may resign at any time by
      posting a message to that effect to the Public Forum, at which
      time e ceases to be Contestmaster.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1612/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Organizations' Compacts

      For each Organization, let there be a SLC associated with that
      Organization called its Compact.

      Unless otherwise specified in the Compact, a Compact can be
      changed by the unanimous consent of all the Players within its
      Jurisdiction.  The Administrator of an Organization is the
      Maintainer of the Organization's Compact.  

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's Compact can vary over the
      period of its existence.  the Administrator of the Organization
      shall maintain a record of the Compact's Jurisdiction.  The
      Compact of an Organization ceases to exist when the Organization
      ceases to exist.
