========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

"Pending draws" are mentioned, and in fact regulated, in several places in the
current ruleset.  For example, there are specific mechanisms for gaining
pending draws in Rule 2075.  Further, Rule 2074 puts a specific regulation in
defining when a pending draw may not be satisfied, thus making pending draws,
and their satisfaction, regulated quantities and actions (R101).  However, the
exact definition of a "pending draw", in particular any link (except by
inference) to card dealing is absent from the ruleset since proposal 4851 took
effect.

R1586p2 implies that the lack of explicit definition for pending draws means
that pending draws no longer exist.  However, I would argue that:

 (1) the existence of regulations for pending draws and their satisfaction,
cited above, requires that they still exist and are regulated quantities;

 (2) it is reasonable to use "pending draws" in the context of cards, in which
ordinary language usage (R754) would lead a reasonable person to infer that
these are outstanding promises that cards should be randomly dealt from the
deck by the Deckmastor, as per the mechanism of dealing as defined by
R2069(d); further, there is no other reasonable ordinary language usage which
makes sense in the context of the current Rules; and

(3) By R1586p3, as long as a definition for pending draw can be inferred and
linked to cards, it is continuous with the former records of pending draws, of
which (at the time proposal 4851 took effect and at the time of this CFJ)
Goethe had at least 1 and Quazie had 0.  As Deckmastor I affirm this last
point to the best of my knowledge.

Hence, under the current ruleset, Goethe may be dealt a card legally, which
would satisfy and lower eir number of pending draws, and Quazie may not.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

Pending draws are mentioned in the SLR of 27 March 2006 (the first
published Ruleset after the CFJ was submitted) in several places --
Rules 1677/14, 2074/1, 2075/8, 2083/2, 2121/0, and 2089/8.  However,
none of these rules define a pending draw.  So under R754/5 (6), we must
fall back on the normal meaning of a "pending draw."  I understand the
term "pending draw" to be an unfulfilled request for a card to be dealt
from a deck.  A more precise definition probably exists, but likely
would amount to much the same thing for our purposes.

Major premiss: R101/2 (c) says that an action is regulated if it would
modify information for which we keep records.
Minor premiss: R 2068/6 says that the Deckmastor is recordkeepor for
cards.
Conclusion, by syllogism:  All actions that affect card holdings are
regulated.

The SLR of 27 March 2006 regulates fulfilling pending draws, as dealing
a card from the deck is an action that affects card holdings -- the card
is transferred from the deck to a subject Gambler.  However, the SLR
does not define any way to fulfill a pending draw; the most the SLR says
(in R2074) is a case when a pending draw may NOT be satisfied.  Since
the SLR regulates card deals, but does not specify even the slightest
workings of dealing a card, dealing a card is not permitted.

Judge OscarMeyr's Evidence:

Rule 101/2 (Power=3)
Agora May I?

      Any player is permitted to perform an action which is not
      regulated.  An action is regulated if:

      (a) the action is prohibited;

      (b) the rules indicate that if certain conditions are satisfied,
          then some player is permitted to perform the action;

      (c) the action would, as part of its effect, modify information
          for which some player is required to be a recordkeepor;

      (d) the action would, as part of its effect, make it impossible
          to make arbitrary modifications to the rules by any
          combinations of actions by players; or

      (e) the courts have held that the action is regulated, and this
          finding has not been overturned.

      A player besides the Speaker is always permitted to deregister
      rather than continue to play.  Please treat Agora right good
      forever.

Rule 2068/6 (Power=1)
The Deckmastor

      The Deckmastor is an office; its holder is responsible for fair
      play, shuffling, and dealing, and is the recordkeepor for cards
      and chips.

      The Deckmastor's weekly report shall contain a record of all
      cards and chips in existence, recent card and chip actions, and
      what entity holds each card and chip.  The Deckmastor need not
      record or report transfers of cards to the table.
