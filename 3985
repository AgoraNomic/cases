Judge Jason's Arguments:

Judged trivially FALSE, since "this message" refers to the message in
which the CFJ was called.

However, I will still resolve the underlying controversy (whether the
message quoted above the CFJ caused a Madrid stamp to be created).

This would be judged trivially FALSE, since the promise would only
transfer a stamp, rather than create one.

However, I will still resolve the underlying controversy (whether the
message quoted above the CFJ caused a Madrid stamp to be transferred).

In order for a stamp to have been created, the string "gilloooooo pa
onde va tu que la feria ta pa lla" must meet be "in the regular text
format that is ubiquitous and traditional for gameplay messages in Agora".

There are two potential interpretations of what "text format" refers to:
the literal encoding of the format (ASCII in this case), or the content
(including semantics) of the message. I find that the latter is what
applies: reasonable encoding is implicit in "string", and, if the
creator of the promise meant the restriction solely to require the
string to be valid ASCII (or UTF-8), e would have simply said so.

Having determined that the requirement includes semantics, we must now
determine whether the string in question meets the requirement. I find
that it does not. Messages in English are what are common and ubiquitous
in Agora, and the string is not readable as English. To the extent that
our precedents permit machine-translatable uses of other languages (even
though they are probably neither common nor ubiquitous), I have also
attempted to run the string through Google Translate, which detects it
as Spanish and translates it to English as "gilloooooo pa where are you
going that the fair ta pa lla", which is also not intelligible.

Thus, the string is not "in the regular text format that is ubiquitous
and traditional for gameplay messages in Agora", so the cashing
conditions were not satisfied, the promise was not cashed, and no stamp
was transferred.

This would be judged FALSE.
