Exhibit by Quazie:

I attempt to join agora nomic.  I attempt to leave agora nomic.  I
wonder if either of those are effective in this bak channel.  I assume
yes.  I wonder if this message will just be seen as an annoyance, I
assume maybe.

Exhibit by omd:

Arguments: I don't see any reason why "I attempt to leave" would be
ineffective.

========================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

The intent is at least as clear as the preceding one. If neither are
sufficient, then Quazie never became a player. If both are, e briefly
was but then left. In both cases, the outcome is the same in regards to
this CFJ: FALSE.
