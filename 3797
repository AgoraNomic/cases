Caller's Evidence:


CFJ 3772.


Rule 2125:

>       An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
>       permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under which
>       the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would, as part
>       of its effect, modify information for which some player is
>       required to be a recordkeepor.


Rule 2350: "A player CAN create a proposal by announcement, specifying
its text and optionally specifying any of the following attributes [...]".

Rule 2166: "An asset's backing document can generally specify when and
how that asset is created, destroyed, and transferred."


Caller's Arguments:

Arguments for TRUE:

{

In CFJ 3772, on whether "Existing is a regulated action", H. Judge G.
found that "Changes in existence state (e.g. ceasing to exist) are
indeed actions". Coming into existence is a change in existence state
and is therefore, by precedent, an action.

Because coming into existence is an action, it can be a Regulated Action
under Rule 2125. The Rules regulate how certain entities can come into
existence. For instance, the rules "enable" proposals to come into
existence when a player creates them, since, without that clause, there
would be no way for a person to create a proposal. Similarly, the rules
allow backing documents to specify how assets can come into existence;
this clause "allows" and "enables" assets to come into existence; these
examples show how the action of coming into existence satisfies
condition (1) of Rule 2125.

Condition (2) also applies in this case, as Rule 2350 specifies that
attempting to create a proposal without specifying certain
characteristics would fail.

}

Arguments for FALSE:

{

The entity coming into existence is not performing an action, since it
doesn't yet exist to perform that action, so the Rules regulating the
creation of things only regulate the action of the creation, and not the
action of the entity coming into existence.

}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge G.'s Arguments:

First to clarify, an action has a subject and an object.  Phrased in the
passive voice focuses on the object coming into existence (without mentioning
the subject) but this statement is identical to asking if creating an object
is a regulated action.  Simply put:

* If the object coming into existence is an "Agoran object" (i.e. something
defined by the rules as per R1586) then the answer is TRUE.

* If the object is wholly non-Agoran (e.g. a widget from a widget factory) the
answer is FALSE.

* If the object is an external object that has Agoran properties attached to
it (e.g. a natural person who has a default Citizenship switch upon birth)
then the "coming into existence" isn't regulated per se, but some of the
follow-on consequences of existence are (e.g. assigning a switch value).

I judge DISMISS (insufficient information exists as it depends on the object
in question).
