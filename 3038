Well, that CFJ found that it is impossible to validly support or
object to an action by merely linking to a Flash video whose contents
amount to "Objection. I support this." There are many reasons not to
consider that a valid support or objection, and the fact that it's a
URL is only one of them.

Caller's Evidence:

I call a CFJ on the statement linked:

Gratuitous Arguments by G.:

The Judge should consider to what extent we can be sure the links
provided by the caller point to the same text/content that they did
when the CFJ was submitted.  The Judge might also consider (if these
are allowed) hypothetical but simple cases such as a "vote" pointing
to a php script that displays a different content for different
people.

Judge Yally's Arguments:

Trivially TRUE, if this case is a CFJ, which in my opinion it is not.
Agoran precedent, as supported by many cases, has rejected links for
many reasons already given. Among these reasons are their ability to
be altered, display different things at different times/to different
people, and other shenanigans. Likewise, the server hosting the site
linked to could go down, making the page inaccessible.
