Judge ais523's Arguments:

Regardless of whether the message has the right form to initiate a CFJ
or not (I think it might do, the effort required to decode it is not too
extreme), it doesn't contain a statement (the characters that appear
after the colon cannot reasonably be parsed as a statement).

As such, I judge CFJ 3243 FALSE. CFJ 3242 doesn't exist, but just in
case, I attempt to judge it MALFORMED (and note that it's impossible to
actually correctly judge a CFJ MALFORMED, as all CFJs for which it's
appropriate don't exist).
