Caller's Arguments:

Arguments for FALSE: "Grant" is a term defined by the rules for use with
assets. Points are not assets. So points cannot be granted, and the
granting of points failed in the quoted message. Granting is a regulated
action, so it cannot be done unless described by the rules, and granting is
not described for points.

Judge ais523's Arguments:

Rule 2577 says "To grant an entity an asset is to create it in eir
possession. To grant an entity a set of assets is to create each asset
in the set in eir possession." So what does the word "grant" mean when
used for something other than an asset?

The rules frequently use the word "grant" in contexts other than
granting assets, e.g. rule 2166, "granted Mint Authority"; rule 2496,
"granted a Degree"; rule 2643, "granted immunity" (and rule 2654,
"grant eir Ministry Focus' Device"). In such situations, it's clear
that they aren't trying to refer to the specific action of granting an
asset, but rather some other meaning of the word "grant". The word
isn't specifically defined by the rules in the context envisaged by
this CFJ – the wording of rule 2577 is clear that it's only defining
"grant" when it applies to an asset or set of assets – so it defaults
to its normal English meaning, as a synonym for "give" or "bestow".

Is this a sufficiently clear synonym for the "add to that player's
score" action in rule 2657? I interpret Jason's form of wording "I
grant X Y points" as ambiguous between "I increase X's score by Y
points" and "I increase X's score by Y points by decreasing my score by
Y points" (based on the regular English meaning of the word 'grant').
So this CFJ comes down to whether Jason successfully "specified the
action" that e wanted to perform, as required by rule 478.

In general, I think that this form of wording might incur some
ambiguity. In this specific case, though, I think there are enough
clues from context that no ambiguity is possible:

a) The action was taken as part of a series of other actions which
unambiguously used "grant" to mean "create in the possession of", and
it would be strange to change the meaning of the word "grant"
repeatedly in the middle of the sequence;

b) The "for the adoption of" prefix makes it clear that this is an
attempt to take the rule 2657 action; and

c) Jason was attempting to grant the points to emself; the "transfer"
meaning of "grant" doesn't make sense in that context, but the "create
in the possession of" meaning does.

So in conclusion, I think Jason got lucky here, that there was only one
plausible way to interpret eir actions. I don't find clue b)
sufficiently convincing, and a) is borderline, but c) is convincing.
Had the details been slightly different, it's quite possible that this
action attempt wouldn't meet the rule 478 standards of unambiguity.

(And to address the caller's argument directly: it is true that "grant
an asset" is a regulated action, but this is not relevant, because the
issue at question is not about whether or not an asset was granted. The
Ruleset as a whole is pretty clear that granting is not something that
is limited to assets.)

I judge CFJ 3983 TRUE.
