Gratuitous arguments by G.:

Well considering I've still got a terminal window open, I could change the
link contents instantly to anything before most people will have seen
it.  Definitely not out of my TDOC if the content of those links is the
only evidence.

I suppose (now that those links are tied to a github repo) one could
cross-reference my message timing to commit timing.

Overall though, I'm pretty sure we've been strong on "publishing X" means
actually publishing the full contents of X, otherwise it's ISID. The cases
that allowed outside references are generally by-announcement actions,
where outside references work because the specification is like this:
   "clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs it"

for this, "announcing e performs it" must be included in the actual
announcement, but the "clearly specifying" part can lead to a link that
has a clear specification.

So this would work:  "I do as in link X"  -> [link X] "I support" because
e announces "I do...", but just providing the same link without an
announced verb/context doesn't do the trick.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

I accept the caller's arguments and judge TRUE.

While G. correctly points out that verifying non-tampering may be a
non-trivial technical exercise, I trust that someone has done it by now
in this case (having had ample time to do so). Also, neither the report
rules nor the definition of "publishing" depend on how easy it is to
perform such verification. How easy would it be to verify that the
Distributor hasn't tampered with a mailing list and/or its web archives?
