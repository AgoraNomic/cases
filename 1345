==============================  CFJ 1345  ==============================

Caller's Arguments:

I am concerned that the Ratification of the Payroll Clerk's Report in
January may have affected the Judicial debts that were outstanding at
the time.

Caller's Evidence:

As evidence, here is a list of Judicial Salary debts that were not
satisfied till Mon 25 Feb 2002, yet some of the CFJs date back to
Nov or Dec 2001:

Motion 1345.422 by Murphy:

I submit a Motion that, if my recent CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the Judge
Order the Payroll Clerk to forgive all debts arising from the payment of
already-satisfied Judicial debts on February 25, 2002.

========================================================================

Judge G.'s Arguments:

Rules 1791, 1551, and 1552 lay out strict requirements for Report
Ratification to be legal.  To summarize, Ratification is only legal if
performed on an official game document by the Player whose Rules-mandated
duties specifically include publishing the information in the document
(1552ii).

Is the Payroll Clerk required to publish Stems Debts to and from the Bank?
The Payroll Clerk's Report is a Rules-mandated document, but its required
(and thus legally Ratifiable) content with respect to Stems is not defined
directly.  Rather, the required content is defined by a combination of
this section of Rule 1942:

      If one of the official duties of an officer is to be the
      recordkeepor of a property, then eir Weekly Report shall include
      this record and any changes thereto since the last posting of
      eir Report.

and Rule 1909:

      The Payroll Clerk is an office; its holder is recordkeepor of
      Stems and is responsible for paying out salaries and other
      compensations.

But what does the "this record and any changes thereto" of 1942 consist
of?  Does it include Debts?  This Court finds that it does not.  From
earlier in R1942:

      Each property shall have a recordkeepor, which is a player
      required to maintain a record of who owns that property.  The
      Treasuror is the recordkeepor for each property that would
      otherwise have no recordkeepor.

From this, the recordkeepor is required to maintain a record of who *owns*
that property, not who owes a debt for that property.  So the Payroll
Clerk's requirement to maintain a record of Stems *ownership* is not
enough to allow the Payroll Clerk to ratify the status of Stems *debts*.

However, there are other avenues to consider which may indirectly create
this publishing requirement with respect to debts.  There is no direct
Rules-definition of a recordkeepor for Debts.  Can we construe one?

The Payroll Clerk's Report produced on January 29 and later ratified,
contained a section labelled "Outstanding Debts".  Its layout, with a
Payor and a Payee, indicates that it might be construed as a record of all
Stems debts (this Court finds it reasonable to assume from context the
currency in question is Stems).

The Court rejects the possibility that the Rules grant any entity the
authority to maintain and publish an "official" record of all debts in a
particular currency.  Were debts Property, the authority to keep records
on them would lie with the Treasuror, as the default "recordkeeper of
Property" (Rule 1942).

However, it is clear from Rule 1596(a) that "obligations to transfer" are
distinct from properties themselves.  Debts may arise privately between
parties; for example, through a Binding Agreement.  There is no general
requirement in the Rules to report or inform any central authority of the
existence of debts.  Certain types of debts (for example, those arising
from Bonds) may have specific notification requirements attached, but
those types of debts are not at issue here, and in those cases the
authority does not belong to the Payroll Clerk.

In general, the Rules grant the Creditor and Debtor certain rights with
regard to debts, and thus this Court finds that, unless otherwise
specified for particular types of debts, it is the sole responsibility of
each Creditor and Debtor to track them.

This leads to the final possibility--that as limited executor of the Bank,
the Payroll Clerk's Report is authoratative (and thus ratifiable) with
respect to Stems debts to and from the Bank.  This is supported by the
first clause of Rule 1470(c) which names the Payroll Clerk as the "Prime
Executor of the Bank with respect to [Stems] debts."

The Court is not persuaded by this argument.  As mentioned above, Rules
1596 and 1599 give specific rights to *both* the Creditor and Debtor of a
particular debt.  A Creditor may forgive a debt, and a Debtor may pay it,
but (in particular) a Debtor may not remove the debt from existence
without the consent of the Creditor.  There is no requirement that any
recordkeepor publish the existence of the debt.  For example, when a Bank
debt is created by "Paying Out," the requirement to announce the debt
belongs to the entity paying out, not to the recordkeepor of the property
involved.

Finally, while the Payroll Clerk is the executor for the Bank's actions as
a Creditor, there is no requirement that e attempt to collect.  If the
Bank is a Debtor, the Creditor may insist on Payment, but even if that
insistence is made, here is no requirement that the Payroll Clerk publish
the existence of the debt.  Since this requirement does not exist, by
1552ii information of debts may not be ratified by the Payroll Clerk, even
when e acts as executor of the Bank with respect to the Bank's Debts.

This Court does not believe that the Payroll Clerk's failure to ratify
Stems debts on January 29 invalidated the legal ratification of eir Record
of the possession and transfers of Stems.
