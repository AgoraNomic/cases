Judge Aris's Arguments:

Through a scam and abuse of the powers of the office of Referee, V.J. Rada
has recently and illegally come into the possession 3000 justice favors. This
is a matter of the utmost importance because these favors would allow em to
win the game in the new week. The Emergency Scam Response System (ESRS)
was activated and V.J. Rada was quickly given a Black Card for betraying
the trust of Agora. This Black Card was given through a loophole, and a CFJ
about whether a punishment can be given under it is ongoing. In the meantime,
a Blue Card was awarded and Fine Levied. V.J. Rada was ordered to distribute
eir ill-gotten gains evenly (more or less) among all players, and
Alexis, the new Referee, soon acted on eir behalf to do so. This urgent
CFJ addresses the validity of the Blue Card payout.

Rule 2506/0, Blue Cards, states that the penalty must be "between 1 shiny and
the greater of 25 shinies and the amount the bad sport profited from the
infraction, in order for the card to be effective." Two of these numbers
are in shinies, but the third one is not explicitly so. The question is whether
or not favors can validly be used as a penalty. I now rule that they can.

The text is vague, but several limitations are abundantly clear. First,
the asset in question must be a currency, both because it is later
referred to as money and because it makes little sense to pay out an amount
of an item where every instance is unique, with unique value. Second, it
must be more than 1 shiny in value. It's quite clear here that that 3000
favors have a value greater than 1 shiny.

The real question is whether 3000 favors can sensibly be compared to 25 shinies,
and if so, whether the favors are the "greater of" the two. First, any two
economic commodities can be reasonably compared in one respect: value. However,
we also need to be able to tell which of the commodities are more valuable,
which depends on context. Here, 3000 favors would allow V.J. to win the game,
and as Corona has recently pointed out, in some sense "wins are the most
valuable asset" (internal quotation marks removed). Most players would pay more
than 25 shinies for a win, and bidding for a win would certainly rise above 25
shinies. The fair market value of 3000 favors is thus indisputably more than
that of 25 shinies. If there were ambiguity about their relative values, I
would be inclined to rule the care invalid, on the basis that no player
should be subject to a questionable punishment; here, there is none.

So far, I have relied solely upon the text of the relevant rule, which I
consider to be quite clear. However, in case there is ambiguity, I will now
consider the Rule 217 interpretive factors. The rule is brand new, so there
are neither game customs nor past judgements to be considered. Common sense
is unclear here, and could quite reasonably argued either way. The interests
of the game emphatically support punishing a player who has done wrong
and stopping em from illegally gaining a win.

A fine in any currency is valid if it is clear that the value of the currency
is greater than that of 25 shinies. Here, that is indisputably the case, and
so the fine is judged to be valid and in accordance with the laws. FALSE.


Judge Aris's evidence

Rule 2506/0 (Power=2)
Blue Cards

  A Blue Card is a type of Card that is appropriate for deliberate or
  negligent infractions either where the the player responsible profited
  from violating the rules or where e significantly harmed another
  person or the game as a whole. The person issuing a Blue Card must, in
  the same message, announce a penalty between 1 shiny and the greater
  of 25 shinies and the amount the bad sport profited from the
  infraction, in order for the card to be effective. E CAN additionally,
  in the same message, determine the distribution of the money between
  Agora and the players(s) harmed, save that e CANNOT distribute money
  to emself or such that it would be under eir effective control. By
  default, all the money goes to Agora.

  When a Blue Card is issued, as a penalty, within the next 7 days, any
  player CAN once, with 2 Support, Levy a Fine upon the bad sport. After
  the Fine is Levied upon the bad sport, e SHALL endeavor in good faith
  to pay the fine to Agora or the correct player(s), in accordance with
  the distribution laid out by the carder. Any player CAN also act on
  the bad sport's behalf to do so, fulfilling eir obligation.
