History:

Called by Walker:                       29 Jun 2011 09:32:55 GMT
Assigned to scshunt:                    03 Jul 2011 17:48:08 GMT
Judged FALSE by scshunt:                03 Jul 2011 21:38:55 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

FALSE as no officer tracks it. The same goes for adoption
index, which means that no recent proposals have actually had an
adoption index. This might mean that proposals with a simple majority
but not VI >= AI actually passed. See CFJ 3020.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by scshunt:

I intend, with two support, to file a motion to reconsider. While I'm
not sure if I agree at all with the conclusion that AI is a useless
property, I would note that any comparison against an undefined value
is, by convention, false where a value is required. Since the judge has
entered the statement about VI >= AI into his arguments, I feel
compelled to request reconsideration so that this does not become precedent.

========================================================================

Judge scshunt's Arguments:

Uh, I'm not sure if this was supposed to be assigned to me, but if it
was, I just FALSE. It has no officer tracking it.
