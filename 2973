==============================  CFJ 2973  ==============================

    If I registered in the quoted message, I would currently be
    District.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 omd

Judge:                                  Murphy
Judgement:                              TRUE

========================================================================

History:

Called by omd:                          03 Feb 2011 00:11:02 GMT
Assigned to Murphy:                     27 Feb 2011 17:31:25 GMT
Judged TRUE by Murphy:                  27 Feb 2011 18:04:00 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

District is the default value, but before I deregistered I
was Supreme.  Rule 2162 (Switches) is very confusingly worded.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

Rule 2226 defines judicial rank as a player switch.  Rule
2162 says "No other entity possesses an instance of that switch".  If
you deregistered, then you became an "other entity" and thus ceased to
possess an instance of the judicial-rank switch.  FALSE.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

Whoops, TRUE, rather.
