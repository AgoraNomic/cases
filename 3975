Judge ais523's Arguments:

The relevant rule is this portion of Rule 1742/23:
{{{
A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions as
explicitly and unambiguously permitted by the contract's body:
[...]
* By announcement, transfer liquid assets from the contract to a
  specified recipient.
}}}

Is it unambiguously true that proposal 305 has an AI? If it can't be
figured out within reasonable effort, then it isn't â€“ the rules are
designed to prevent "escalation of ambiguities" in which uncertainty
about a contract's gamestate expands to uncertainty about the gamestate
as a whole, and the "unambiguously" prevents that because if something
can't be calculated without unreasonable effort, it doesn't
unambiguously have a particular value.

By rule 1950, all proposals have an AI by definition ("none" is a
possible AI value for Agoran decisions, but not for proposals, thus all
proposals have an AI). As such, the condition in the contract
unambiguously collapses to "'proposal 305' exists and is a proposal"
(because if 'proposal 305' doesn't exist, or it's ambiguous which
entity it refers to, or whether that entity is a proposal, the contract
isn't unambiguously making the transfer possible).

Does proposal 305 unambiguously exist as a proposal, in an Agora-legal
sense? I don't think we can say that it does. (There's enough publicly
available information to determine (with considerable effort) that
there was a proposed Rule Change numbered 305, and even to get an idea
of what it was, but not to determine whether it is a "proposal" in the
modern sense or some other sort of entity (because that depends on the
entire history of changes to Agora's proposal system). The rules for
contracts permitting things don't care about whether the statement is
true, but how easy it is to determine that it's true; the standard
should be at least that a reasonable Agoran could work it out without
unreasonable effort after checking a couple of reports, and the
existence of 'proposal 305' as a current proposal clearly doesn't meet
that standard. Doubts about the facts introduce ambiguity.)

According to the Treasuror's Report of June 13 (which has since self-
ratified), Madrid had 6806 coins at that point. I didn't notice any
coin transfers that would have affected Madrid's total between the
report and the transfers. As such, Madrid should have had 6804 coins at
the time of calling the CFJ.

I judge CFJ 3975 FALSE.
