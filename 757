Statement:

"Acting Promotor Vanyel violated rule 783 by distributing proposal
1535."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Rule 783 states:
Proposals which contain clauses awarding, trading, penalizing, or otherwise
changing the account of any Nomic Entity's holding of Points or any form of 
currency based on the Vote they cast on that Proposal are invalid, shall not
be deemed to have been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted on.

Proposal 1535:
Amend our oldest Rule!

Amend Rule 312 to read:
If a Voter votes and if e voted FOR the Amendment of Rule 312,
e gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting Period.

[The obvious and direct intent of this Proposal is to redefine the
conditions upon which a Player will receive the Vote award.
As such it does not conflict with 1003.]

Proposal 1535 penalizes players who don't vote FOR it, and is in violation of
rule 783

#### Note: ####
I don't think the EV proposals violate this, because they award EVs (a
currency) based on votes on _other_ proposals.
Of course by this reasoning I would also call a proposal such as:
'every time a Player votes for a proposal submitted by Pascal, e receives 10
points'
legal...
IMO, the coersion (sp?) and bonus clause rules need to be revised...

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE.

Rule 783 specifically states that any Proposals "which contain clauses
awarding" ... "Points" ... "based on the Vote they cast on that Proposal" 
are "invalid, shall not be deemed to have been properly submitted, and
shall not be Voted upon."  Since Proposal 1535 specifically awards Points 
to Players based on their Voting FOR Proposal 1535, by Rule 783 this 
Proposal invalid, not properly submitted, and should not have been Voted 
upon.  The fact that the Points are not awarded immediately is immaterial 
- Rule 783 does not specify a time limit in which the Point awards must 
take place, and the stated awards on future Proposals are directly tied 
to the Players' Votes on 1535.

However:

While I believe that Proposal 1535 was indeed "invalid", "not properly 
submitted" and should "not have been Voted upon", the fact remains that 
at no place in Rule 783 does it say that the Promotor shall not 
distribute such an invalid Proposal, nor does any other Rule I have been 
able to ascertain.  Therefore, in no way did Acting Promoter Vanyel 
violate Rule 783 by distributing Proposal 1535, and I am constrained to 
find this CFJ FALSE.

I would like to note that, while the I believe the submission of this 
Proposal to be legal, I suspect that all Votes cast on it, including 
this Judges, were NOT legal, and should not be counted., by virtue of 
Rule 783.

       I have been told that when a large group of people believe in a
     fantasy, it is called a culture.  When a small group believes, it is
      called a cult.  When two people believe in a fantasy, it is called
	 love; and when one person believes, it is called psychosis.
