===============================  CFJ 3433  ===============================

      If the Rules unconditionally allow someone to perform a certain
      rule change by announcement (not as the result of, e.g., a
      dependent action), then it is generally possible for the "general
      player review" clause in Rule 105 to be satisfied (e.g. through a
      formal but non-Rules-specified process).

Judge Eritivus's Arguments:

The relevant clause of R105 was:

      A rule change which would otherwise take effect without its
      substance being subject to general player review through a
      reasonably public process is wholly prevented from taking
      effect.

We must distinguish between two processes here. First, the
'performing' process, directly through which a rule change takes
effect (e.g. by announcement). Second, the 'reviewing' process, which
must be reasonably public.

Neither the clause itself nor other rules specify that the performing
and reviewing processes must be identical, and the clause places no
restrictions at all on the performing process. Thus, the question of
whether a "by announcement" performing process can satisfy this clause
is easy. Yes, trivially.

If it were not for the ending parenthesis in the statement
("e.g. through a formal but non-Rules-specified process"), this would
be enough for TRUE. I take the parenthesis to mean that the statement
also asks whether the reviewing process can be non-rules-specified.

G. has argued that "reasonably public process" might be interpreted as
"reasonably public rules-specified process". While game custom does
not support this interpretation, G. notes that much context has
changed, e.g. induction and agreements are gone.

Despite the changed context, I find no reason to overturn past custom
here (other than the tactical reason of defeating a dictatorship). A
reasonably public process is a reasonably public process regardless of
whether it is specified by the rules.

I judge TRUE.
