Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

1486:  DISMISSED.  CFJs decide issues of fact and of the Rules,
not of intent.  Accordingly, a CFJ on whether a nickname "should" refer
to a particular entity is not relevant.  Therefore R1565(iii) applies.
The Court notes that a valid CFJ would be one that claims that a
nickname does, or does not, refer to a particular entity.

Judge OscarMeyr's Evidence:

Evidence 1:  R991

Rule 991/5 (Power=2)
Invoking Judgement

      Any person may request formal resolution of a dispute pertaining
      to this Nomic by submitting a Call for Judgement (CFJ) to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The submission of a CFJ constitutes proof
      of the existence of such a dispute.

      A CFJ should be a single clearly-labeled Statement whose truth
      or falsity can be determined using logical reasoning, assuming
      perfect knowledge.  A CFJ may be accompanied by Arguments,
      Evidence, or other related material; the Judge is encouraged,
      but not required, to take notice of these things.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall publish the text of a CFJ, along
      with any additional material submitted by the Caller (including
      but not limited to Arguments and Evidence), no later than the
      time e announces the identity of the first Judge assigned to
      that CFJ.

Evidence 2:  R1565

Rule 1565/10 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judgement of DISMISSED should be delivered if and only if one
      or more of the following is true:

        i) The CFJ does not contain a single clearly-identified
           Statement.

       ii) After a reasonable effort to obtain all relevant
           information, the Judge can neither determine the Statement
           to be true nor determine it to be false.

      iii) The Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.

       iv) The CFJ lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
