======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

I have nothing to add to the Caller's Arguments, except to note that
higher Powered Rules are generally able to defer to lower Powered
Rules by avoiding conflict (e.g. by saying "unless another Rule says
otherwise").

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

This follows directly from the wording of R1482, which states that:

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.
