Gratuitous Arguments by Yally:

Nicknames have long been established as not really meaning
anything. Therefore, regardless of the day, e will still be Warrigal,
or uorygl, or whatever nicknames e has chosen for himself that
unambiguously refer to em. Even if e announces that e no longer wishes
to be called Warrigal, e will still be Warrigal. Generally, though, if
a player's requests for name changes are infrequent and reasonable,
they'll be respected by the Agoran community.

========================================================================

Judge ais523's Arguments:

The key to these cases is that nicknames are not regulated by the rules
(apart from the prohibition on selecting a confusing nickname in rule
2170, which is mostly irrelevant here); instead, a "nickname" is a name
by which a person is generally referred to in informal settings
(according to my understanding of the standard English meaning). At the
moment, the phrase in question in CFJ 2774 is far from a customary way
to refer to Warrigal / uorygl, so CFJ 2774 is trivially FALSE.

As for CFJ 2775, it is probably too early to say what name the player in
question will be referred to as in most people's minds tomorrow. I most
easily think of the player as Warrigal (and to some extent, even
ihope127 / Ivan Hope; if that's someone else, my memory of nickname
changes must be really confused...), but if everyone starts calling em
uorygl, that name could be being used instead. (And it's even possible
for a person to gain a nickname they didn't select for emself; this
happens frequently in non-Agoran settings, although the only example I
can think of in Agora is G. being referred to as Gravity for a short
length of time after eir name change until e stated eir preferred
abbreviation publicly.) Nickname changes don't work by changing some
magic switch in the gamestate; instead, they work because one person
asks to be called by a certain name, and other people follow suit.
Therefore, there's currently not enough data to know what nickname
Warrigal / uorygl will have tomorrow, and I judge CFJ 2775 UNDETERMINED.
(Note that this would also be the result even if nickname changes were
rules-defined but not rate-limited, due to the possibility that e would
change eir nickname again some time today.)
