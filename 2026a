Panelist woggle's Arguments:

This panel judges REMAND.

H. Murphy's argument that clause 0 could be removed without changing anything
else is irrelevant. It is there, and if it is possible for contracts to bind
people to other documents by the act of agreeing to them, it does. H. Prior
Judge Wooble made the reasonable conclusion that it does here.

H. comex's argument that clause 0 is merely a statement of fact also does not
cast sufficient doubt on the H. Prior Judge's conclusion. It is not
conventional to render entire clauses of contracts and rules without effect
without a good reason. Indeed, as comex's argument points out, it would render
the statement of fact false had it no effect, even though it seems entirely
within the power of the contract to render it true. This is materially
different from the case of 'the contestmaster shall be root' where the rules
entirely take precedence over the contract's ability to render that "fact"
true.

Now, there is a troubling issue here which has not been examined. As the exact
text of The Right Hand is not available, a party to the left hand joining as
permitted in clause 7 may not be able to be automatically bound by The Right
Hand under R101(v). This makes it less clear whether The Right Hand is
functionally part of The Left Hand.

The panel requests that H. Prior Judge Wooble examine this issue and revise
eir judgement accordingly.
