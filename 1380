Caller's Arguments:

The the recent MASSIVE CURRENCY UPHEAVAL scam relied upon a message
transferring moneys to the bank, so that the scammers would be broke. They
therefore would not incur any debts, and knew it. So when Goethe, acting on
behalf of four entities, claimed (four times) that these debts "do not exist
(but may soon)", ey committed Misrepresentation, once for each such false
claim.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

R1497:
-----
Rule 1497/8 (Power=1)
Truth in Advertising

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of evidence submitted in support of a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement, or in response to a Judicial or
      Appellate Order requiring that Player to disclose information
      known to that Player, commits the Class 10 Crime of Perjury.

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of a public message, as any part of a response to a request for
      information where that Player was required to respond, or as
      part of a message to an Officer upon which that Officer is then
      required to act, commits the Class 4 Crime of Misrepresentation.

      For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be considered
      an Officer.

      For the purpose of this Rule, for a Player to "willfully make a
      false statement of fact", all of the following conditions must
      be true at the time the Player makes the statement.

        a) The Player must present the statement as if it were true.

        b) The Player must know that the statement is false.  In
           particular, the following things are not willful: excusable
           negligence, reasonable error, or reasonable reliance on the
           representations of another.

        c) The statement is not a conclusion as to the interpretation
           of the Rules, or as to their application to a particular
           situation.

I also submit part of a message from Goethe on May 27, subject "Some simple
transfers", which inludes the following:
-----
I transfer 1.215 VEs, 0.023 Indulgences, and 1737 Stems from myself
to the Bank to satisfy debts which do not exist (but may soon).

Acting as OscarMeyr's Executor, I transfer 1.1 VEs, 0.996 Indulgences,
and 157 Stems from OscarMeyr to the Bank to satisfy debts which do not
exist (but may soon).

Acting as Anemocrats Executor I transfer 0.5 Papyri from the Anemocrats
to the Bank to satisfy debts which do not exist (but may soon).

Acting as AgoraEx Offshore Executor, I transfer 0.252 VEs, 17.498 Papyri,
and 1.032 Indulgences, from AgoraEx Offshore to the Bank to satisfy debts
which do not exist (but may soon).

Judge Steve's Arguments:

I have nothing to add to Judge Sir Toby's arguments in CFJ 1382. Goethe
used language effecitvely identical to that used by Steve when e claimed
that the debts e was satisfying "do not exist (but may soon)". That
claim was not only not wilfully false, but arguably true. The debts did
not then exist, and Goethe could have reasonably believed that if e had
not acted as e did, they would soon.
