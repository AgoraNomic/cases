Background:

The Vote Market agreement does not clearly specify the form of an
announcement of a Buy Ticket. It does specify that a Buy Ticket has
the following attributes:
* A description of an action
* A cost in one or more currencies (typically VP), which may be
conditional or variable as long as it can be determined with certainty
when that ticket is filled
* Optionally, a set of target parties. If not specified, this defaults
to the set of all parties to the Vote Market agreement. Only parties
designated as targets may fill a ticket.

Furthermore the Vote Market contract specifies that: A Buy Ticket that
has been filled expires and ceases to exist unless otherwise specified
by its poster.

So the primary question is whether "This ticket may be filled multiple
times (a maximum of once per each player) and does not expire until
revoked." was sufficient to specify an appropriate conditional set of
target parties.

Argument:

I find that there is genuine ambiguity on this point. "per" could mean
"for each" or "by each". But is not in the best interests of the game
that a contract-like text (which this Buy Ticket is) be interpreted
against its writer's intent when (a) its writer's intent was clear;
and (b) everyone else bound to that text (relevantly including ais523
in this case) knew or clearly should have known that the writer's
intent was a reasonable interpretation of the contract-like text.
