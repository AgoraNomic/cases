Caller's Arguments:

I note that solublefish has been extraordinarily gracious enough to
provide eir Mentor's Bonus to me.  Okay (deep breath).  Let's see where
this goes.

I note that by Rule 1976:
      "The award is made by public announcement. Upon such an
      announcement the Bank shall incur a debt to the named Mentor
      equal to the New Player Award."
I also note that by Rule 1677:
      "Whenever the Rules indicate that the Bank incurs a debt to an
      entity equal to the New Player Award, the Bank shall instead
      incur for each Bank Currency a debt to that entity equal to the
      New Player Award for that Currency."

Therefore, I announce that following has taken place:

   (1) As indicated by Rule 1677, The Bank has incurred a debt to Goethe
       equal to the New Player Award;

   (2) There are four Bank currencies.  By Rule 1976, instead of
       incurring a debt equal to the New Player Award as indicated by Rule
       1677, for each of the Bank Currencies, the Bank has instead (for
       that currency) incurred a debt to Goethe equal to the New Player
       Award;

   (3) For each of these four debts equal to the New Player Award, instead
       of incurring a debt equal to the New Player Award, the Bank has
       instead incurred (for each of Bank Currency of which there are
       four) a debt to Goethe equal to the New Player Award;

   (4) etc.

Following this sequence, I announce that, as of solublefish's public
announcement of the Mentor's Award to Goethe, the Bank incurred an
infinite number of debts equal to the New Player Award, to Goethe, for
each Bank currency.  I announce (post notice of) these debts as per Rule
1596.

I further note that each of these debts has a minimum (finite) value
of the MUQ of a Bank Currency, by Rule 1893.

I realize that I cannot issue impossible orders to Officers for them to
satisfy an infinite number of debts.  However, I issue the following
Private Orders:

   (i) I Order the Assessor to partially satisfy the Bank's debts to
       Goethe by transferring 1.0 VEs to em.

  (ii) I Order the Herald to partially satisfy the Bank's debts to Goethe
       by transferring 2.0 Indulgences to em.

 (iii) I Order the Promoter to partially satisfy the Bank's debts to
       Goethe by transferring 2.0 Papyri to em.

  (iv) I Order the Payroll Clerk to partially satisfy the Bank's debts to
       Goethe by transferring 400 Stems to em.

[That's 2 of the "intended New Player" awards, one for each Bank
 Currency if that Number later becomes important.].

I hereby Stay all of the above Orders to prevent the above Officers from
being blotted for not carrying them out if judgements are pending.
Further, I shall not, as Herald, follow said Orders until other
Recordkeepors do so, or blotting becomes inevitable.

Finally, I announce that I intend, should the above explicitly Ordered
Transfers be made, to forgive all outstanding debts owed to Goethe by the
Bank.

Finally, I CFJ on the following statement:  The Bank has incurred an
infinite number of debts to Goethe for each Bank Currency, and each of
these debts is a debt for a minimum of 1 MUQ of one of the Bank
Currencies.

========================================================================

Judge root's Arguments:

From Rule 1677:

       Whenever the Rules indicate that the Bank incurs a debt to an
       entity equal to the New Player Award, the Bank shall instead
       incur for each Bank Currency a debt to that entity equal to the
       New Player Award for that Currency.

  I find that when this clause of Rule 1677 is activated, it does not
create a debt equal to the New Player Award, but instead creates four debts
each equal to a particular part of the New Player Award. As Steve wrote,
"the whole is not equal to any of the parts considered separately."

  By this logic, events (3) and (4) of the Caller's arguments cannot take
place, because the debts created in event (2) do not meet the requirements
to activate the above clause of Rule 1677: specifically, that the Bank has
incurred a debt equal to the New Player Award. If events (3) and (4) fail
to happen, then the Bank has incurred only four debts, and not an infinite
number.

  Therefore, I judge CFJ 1299 FALSE.
