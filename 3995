Caller's Arguments:

The list of scoring conditions in R2657/6 is clearly meant to be
exhaustive based on the wording. Game custom is against reading the
rules to incorporate the effects of contracts unless explicitly stated.

Rule 2657/6 (Power=1)
Scoring

      Each time a player fulfills a scoring condition, the officer
      associated with the condition CAN once by announcement, and SHALL
      in an officially timely fashion, add to that player's score the
      associated amount of points, rounded down.
      
      Below is a list of scoring conditions and their associated points
      and officers.
      
        * Being the author of a proposal that takes effect: 5
          (Assessor).
      
        * Being a coauthor of a proposal that takes effect: 1
          (Assessor).
      
        * Having an Agoran Birthday: 15 (Herald).
      
        * Receiving any patent title: 10 (Herald).
      
        * Receiving a ribbon: 5 (Tailor).

Judge G.'s Arguments:

This is a typical example of the contract says it CAN, therefore it
CAN fallacy that has plagued Agora for a long time.  Score is a
regulated switch.  A scoring condition is a simple shorthand for
defining a CAN for flipping the switch; i.e. it is the same as writing
out "The Assessor CAN and SHALL add 5 points to the score of the
author of an adopted proposal" etc.  So "defining a scoring condition"
is simply enabling a specific type of CAN.  Contract text is not magic
(any more so than announcements), and is only able to enable CANs with
explicit permission from the rules.  Currently, those permissions are
limited to enabling acting-on-behalf, transfers/destruction of
currencies held by the contract, and exercising mint authority for
currencies defined by the contract.  Since none of these things
involve flipping rules-defined switches, the contract CANNOT enable
such switch flipping.  I judge FALSE.

However, as an addendum, any "scoring condition" adds a "SHALL in an
officially timely fashion" as well as a CAN.  Since Contracts CAN
define SHALLs that apply to parties, the contract's scoring condition
*has* made a requirement for Murphy to perform this impossible task,
and since Murphy is a party to the contract, failure to do so would
(possibly) be a rules violation which Murphy could have reasonably
avoided, if the contract requirement still exists when the deadline
expires.
