Call for Judgement from delphin (Sun Aug  1 21:01:13 GMT 1993)

"Proposal 339 is silly."

I find this statement to be FALSE.

			 --------------------

Justification:

Proposal 339 may be many things; vague, inappropriate or even misled,
but I would not label it silly. Just as in the proposal itself, I am
not provided with any method for deciding what is silly and what is
not, so this Judgement must rely on my own discretion. Proposal 339 is
not silly.
