===============================  CFJ 3987  ===============================

      Delivering a CFJ judgement that doesn't accord with the first
      paragraph of R217 is a rules violation.

Caller's Arguments:

First, I think it's a very slippery slope to suggest punishing judges for
judgements, at least for the vast majority of disagreements - I'm not at
all sure if judgements, even bad faith ones, should be penalized at all.
But I want to determine if submitting "bad" judgements (for certain values
of "bad") is actually a violation of any rule, just so we know.

For the first CFJ, R217 reads in part:
>     When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
>     takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
>     unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
>     judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
Note that this is imperative.  It could/should be read "the text of the
rules SHALL take precedence" and "it SHALL be augmented by game custom,
common sense, past judgements, and consideration of the bests interests of
the game" without changing meaning (the imperative reads very much as a
SHALL, not a SHOULD).  CFJs are clearly the rules-recognized means for
"interpreting and applying" rules.  So failure to "interpret and apply"
rules via a CFJ in accordance with this paragraph would violate this rule.

For the second CFJ, R591 defines circumstances under which different
judgements are "appropriate".  By inference, any judgements that don't fit
the criteria are "inappropriate".  By dictionary definition,
"inappropriate" means "not suitable or proper in the circumstances" and
the example sentence given by google is actually "there are penalties for
inappropriate behavior" which implies that it means a rules violation.
(Though unlike the first, imperative-tense CFJ, "inappropriate" is weaker
than e.g. "invalid" so this maybe governed by the equivalent to a SHOULD,
not a SHALL).

For both CFJs, there's the possibility that a bad faith judgement also
violates R101's "Please treat Agora Right Good Forever" but I think that's
much more of a stretch.

Judge ais523's Arguments:

With the respect to CFJ 3987: the first sentence of R217 is not a
statement specifically about how judgements are made, but rather a
statement about how the rules apply generally. This is something that
can have gamestate effects when we have badly worded rules (which can,
in close cases, make it difficult to work out what the platonic
gamestate is – but the fact that past judgements are factored into R217
will typically mean that once a judgement has been made in a very close
case, it will tip the balance and the rules will then start acting in
accordance with the judgement).

This rather raises the question of what it means for a judgement to
"not be in accordance" with the first paragraph of R217 – I can't read
the CFJ's statement as applying to the "TRUE", "FALSE" or whatever
(because this doesn't normally directly reveal any particular
interpretation of the rules), so it must apply to the judge's
reasoning. And that reasoning seems to be entirely unregulated, as far
as I can tell – there doesn't seem to be a current requirement for
judge's reasoning to exist at all, nor to match the verdict, and only
rule 2471 requires the judge to believe that it's true. (There is a
SHOULD for posting reasoning when filing a motion to extend, but it's
hard to read that as binding on judgements more generally.) As such, I
don't think there's any rules breach in delivering a verdict for the
CFJ together with entirely specious arguments that a) don't support the
verdict or b) don't match the text of the rules.

CFJ 3987: FALSE
