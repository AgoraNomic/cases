Judge's Arguments

The question I am here to decide is whether a message sent by Quazie has caused
em to be registered. The relevant part of the message reads "Additionally - as a
non-player I give Murphy the right to make me a player under his control,
effectively giving him my agoran power of attorney. This power is
non-transferable to any other entity than myself, and this non-transferableness
shall not be overridden by any other entity than myself.  I can and will reclaim
this power from Murphy when I different message post a message to an agoran
public forum containing the text "There can be only one", thus highlandering
these rights back to myself."

It seems clear that under the broad freedom granted for registrations, if a
"Power of Attorney" (PoA) can exist as a matter of Agoran law, Quazie must have
succeeded and is a player. As I see it, the matter of Quazie's status can
therefore be broken down into several questions. If the answer to any of them is
yes, than e has registered successfully.

1. Did Quazie's message make em a player even if eir PoA failed?
2. Did Quazie's PoA succeed?
3. Is Quazie a player by some other means, such as by ratification?

Quazie's message stated that Murphy could "make me a player under his control".
As there is nothing in that message separating "a player" and "under his
control", I find that they are one action, and that if one part
failed, the other did
as well. The answer 1 is therefore No.

Question 2 is more complicated. We do not currently have a rule-defined
contract system, which makes this somewhat hard to decide. In the presence of a
contract system, it would probably be a yes. It is hard to decide whether game
custom allows such a contract like agreement to exist without rules
acknowledging the existence of contracts. However, this matter has already been
resolved by CFJ 2397, which found that PoA's can exist without contracts under
game custom.

The second question is further complicated by the existence of Agencies. An
Agency is a formal, rule defined way to allow someone to act on behalf of
another player. The rule defining Agencies makes no attempt to restrict other
methods of acting on behalf of another player. As I think that disallowing use
of old traditions in favor of only allowing that which is explicitly defined
by the rules would make the game boring, I find the answer to question 2 to be
Yes.

As question two has been answered in the affirmative, question three is
irrelevant. However, O.D. (obiter dicta), CFJs 1836 and 3455 probably make it a
No.

In accordance with my conclusions regarding question 2, I find this CFJ to be
TRUE.

Judge's evidence

Rule 2467:
An Agency is a document empowering persons to act on behalf of
another player. A player may establish an Agency With 24 hours
Notice and thereby become its Director by specifying the
properties of the new Agency:
      a) A title, which must be exactly three words, not
         counting conjunctions, articles or prepositions.
      b) A non-empty list of persons other than the Head (the
         Agents).
      c) A description of a set of actions (the Powers).


An Agency's Head may amend its properties or revoke it with 24
hours Notice. For greater certainty, an announced intent to
create an Agency or amend an Agency's powers is INEFFECTIVE
unless it explicitly specifies the new values of the properties
being created or amended.

The Powers of an Agency may only be stated as actions and, in
particular, may not be conditional on date, time, game state, or
preconditions, except to the extent that they are required for
the action to be POSSIBLE. Except as allowed by this rule, any
conditions written in the Powers of an Agency are INEFFECTIVE
without affecting the overall validity of the Agency or its
Powers.

An Agency, once created, SHOULD be referred to by the acronym
formed from its title with conjunctions, articles, and
prepositions removed. The acronym of an agency must be unique
and any attempt to create or amend an Agency such that two
Agencies would have the same acronym is INEFFECTIVE.

The Agents of an Agency may perform the Actions described in the
Powers of the Agency on behalf of the Agency's Head.
