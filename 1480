Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1581/3 (Quarterly Speaker Change, Power=1) reads:
      A Speaker Transition occurs upon the commencement of each
      new quarter.
and according to Rule 459/5 (Agoran Epochs, Power=1), this automatic
event would occur on January 1:
      Automatic events that happen daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,
      or yearly happen at the beginning of the corresponding Agoran
      epoch.
However the beginning of the first quarter on January 1 (and
incidentally the second quarter on April 1) occurs during Agoran
holidays by Rules 1870 and 1787.  And thus, the timing of speaker
transition commencement is an event occuring during a holiday,
and with both Power of 2 and claimed precedence, Rule 1769
(Power=2) reads:
      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

It is possible, as some version of this issue has been in play for
some time, that perhaps 50% of speaker transitions have been
incorrectly announced and thus not completed ;).

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

Rule 1769 reads, in part:

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

Goethe points out that the quarterly Speakerly Transition is based upon
the beginning of the quarter (Rule 1581), which in turn is based upon
the beginning of the Agoran quarter (Rule 459).

However, I interpret the phrase "future event" as follows:  if the
timing of event X depends on the timing of event Y, then this portion
of Rule 1769 applies only if event X would (in the absence of any
Holidays) occur after event Y.  In this case, all three events occur
simultaneously, so Rule 1769 does not apply.  (Amending Rule 1769 to
make this interpretation explicit is left as an exercise for the
student.)

Since this is evidently Goethe's sole basis for alleging the truth of
the statement, I hereby judge the statement FALSE.  I also deny Goethe's
request that I order an official annotation of Rule 1581.

Note that the ASAP requirement in Rule 402(ii) (Speaker Transition) *is*
a future event (the deadline) based on the time of a prior event (the
beginning of the Transition), and thus the time limit is extended due
to Holidays in January and April.  This is, of course, exactly what
Holidays are intended to do.  :)
