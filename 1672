Caller's Arguments:

R2138 Defines the IADoP.

Rule 2138/1 (Power=1)
The International Associate Director of Personnel

     The International Associate Director of Personnel is an office;
     its holder is responsible for keeping track of officers and
     reports.

     The IADoP's report shall include the following:

     a) The holder of each office.
     b) The date on which each holder last came to hold that office.
     c) The date of the most recent attempt to achieve Agoran Consent
        for changing the holder of that office.


R1006 notes that the Director of Personnel must perform a certain action:

(Excepted from R1006)

     If no attempt to achieve Agoran Consent for changing the holder
     of a particular office is announced in a given quarter, then the
     Director of Personnel shall make at least one such attempt to
     change the officeholder in the following quarter, and make the
     change if consent is acheived.

The dictionary notes that an Associate is "a person who shares actively in
anything as a business, enterprise, or undertaking; partner; colleague; fellow
worker"

Thus while the IADoP may share activly with the DoP I believe that e is not
the DoP and thus has no obligations other than to make eir report.

Judge The Hanging Judge's Arguments:

The rules define the term "International Associate Director of Personnel",
and use but do not define "Director of Personnel".  There is no other
use of the words "director" or "personnel".  Considering the ruleset as
a whole, then, the only reasonable interpretation of the term "Director
of Personnel" is as an abbreviation of "International Associate Director
of Personnel".

This would of course change if some rule were amended to define "Director
of Personnel".  It might also change in some other cases, for example if
some special meaning were attached to the word "Director"; this could
render "Director of Personnel" unclear or ambiguous, or unambiguously
give it a different meaning.

The caller's note on the dictionary definition of "associate" is specious.
The rules have always given words and phrases special meanings that are
somewhat divorced from their usual English meanings, especially when
(as here) the words are capitalised.  In this case the use of "associate"
is part of the name of an office, so its English meaning is essentially
suppressed.
