Caller's Arguments:

The proposal claims that the portions of the amendment it made
to rule 1023 are severable, however, it's not entirely clear to me whether
that means that the title change is severable. Can it be severed, and the
rest of the amendment succeed, on the basis that an amendment cannot change
the title of a rule? Or could it be interpreted as severing the non-title
amendments and having only the title change succeed? Or does the entire
thing fail because both of these are reasonable interpretations, and this
constitutes sufficient ambiguity for Rule 105's purposes?


Caller's Evidence:

The relevant section of the proposal in question:

Amend Rule 1023, "Common Definitions", by (please note that these actions
are severable):

    * removing the third item of the top level list;
    * renumbering appropriately; and
    * changing its title to "Agoran Time"

Judge o's Arguments:

TRUE.

This is the core of this group of CFJs [CFJs 3599-3601], and the true matter 
in question.

Proposal 7924’s history is troubling. Its text was accidentally omitted from a 
number of reports and official messages, which made its effects on the rules 
harder to determine. Furthermore, that proposal substantially enacted the bulk 
of the current Contracts rules - it’s not a minor proposal. As near as I can 
tell, the portions of that proposal intended to affect rule 1023 are:

> Amend Rule 1023, "Common Definitions", by (please note that these actions
> are severable):
>
>    * removing the third item of the top level list;
>    * renumbering appropriately; and
>    * changing its title to "Agoran Time"

At the start of the application of the proposal, and in fact immediately 
before the application of this group of changes, rule 1023 was in fact titled 
“Common Definitions”. We can decompose the sequence of changes unambiguously 
and uniquely into the following sequence:

> Amend rule 1023 (“Common Definitions”) by removing the third item of the top level list.

I can see no reason this should not have succeeded. This is a minimally-
abstracted way of specifying a change to the text, which is well-defined under 
and allowed by rule 105.

> Amend rule 1023 (“Common Definitions”) by renumbering appropriately.

The wording is somewhat sloppy, but unproblematic, as renumbering all numbered 
things in the text of the rule has the most likely intended effect. Again, 
rule 105 allows this and gives it a well-defined meaning.

> Amend rule 1023 (“Common Definitions”) by changing its title to "Agoran Time”.

Retitling a rule is, again, allowed and given a specific meaning by rule 105, 
and at this point in the sequence of changes, there is no ambiguity as to 
which single rule this change should have been applied to.

It is already true that the clauses of a proposal are severable, in the sense 
that one failing clause does not automatically cause the entire proposal to be 
without effect, and the reminder that the three atomic rule changes given in 
proposal 7924 are severable does not change the interpretation of that 
proposal.
