Caller's Arguments:

Rule 2178 does not specify anyone to track these switches
(although I'm tracking them unofficially). As a result, by rule 2162,
they aren't switches. I'm not sure whether they still have values
anyway, though.

========================================================================

Judge Tiger's Arguments:

Since the definition of the Disclosure switch does not include which
Officer keeps track of it, it does not fulfill R2162's definition of
"a type of switch", therefore it is not a type of switch according to
R2162. Interpreting "switch" in it's ordinary-language sense gives
that a switch can be flipped and has exactly one value, however there
might be things specified for switches in R2162 that do not follow
from the ordinary-language sense. However, this CFJ was only about the
alleged switches having values at all, which I judge they do. At least
one such switch has been flipped to Public, so I judge TRUE.
