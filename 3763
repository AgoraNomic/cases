===============================  CFJ 3763  ===============================

      If an Unregistered person's citizenship switch is flipped to
      Registered by the effect of a power-3.1 proposal, without that
      person expressing any sort of consent, then 1 second after the
      proposal has taken effect, that person is bound to abide by the
      Rules.

Caller's Arguments:

R869 reads in part:
 >     A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
 >     CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
 >     that person's willful consent.

If acting on behalf of oneself, setting the citizenship switch to 
Registered
via announcement also serves as an act of consent.  But if the citizenship
switch is flipped by a proposal with the power to do so, you end up with
the switch at "registered" without any consent being given.

Some alternatives:
- The person is therefore bound by the rules afterwards anyway;
- The registration holds for an instant, then the lack of consent "asserts
   itself" to flip the switch back a moment later.
- The switch stays set at registered, but the person is not "bound to
   abide" by the Rules.  I have no idea what that means in practical 
terms.
- It's somehow impossible for the proposal to flip the switch in the
   first place (meaning the conditional in the CFJ is a counterfactual,
   leading to a dismiss or irrelevant result).

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 869/45 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

       Any organism that is generally capable of freely originating and
       communicating independent thoughts and ideas is a person. Rules to
       the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are persons.

       Citizenship is a person switch with values Unregistered (default)
       and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. Changes to citizenship
       are secured. A registered person is a Player. To "register"
       someone is to flip that person's Citizenship switch from
       Unregistered to Registered.

       An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
       prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
       indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
       intends to become a player at that time. A player, acting as
       emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player) by announcement. If
       e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered for 30 days.

       A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
       CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
       that person's willful consent.

       The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
       or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
       unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
       to the contrary notwithstanding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

I interpret this as follows:

  * If the person consented during that final one-second interval, then
    the statement might be true (albeit difficult to verify). But the
    person /could/ fail to consent during that interval, which is enough
    to avoid an automatic TRUE judgement.

  * "A person, by registering" is not triggered by /being/ registered by
    the actions of others.

  * The Rules count as an agreement. Even if they don't, the Rules don't
    claim that a person who is registered by the actions of others
    thereby agrees to abide by the Rules.

  * The Rules don't define Citizenship as depending on such agreement,
    so it doesn't. The person in question would remain a player, but not
    bound to abide by the Rules.

FALSE.
