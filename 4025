===============================  CFJ 4025  ===============================

      In G's investigation, G violated Rule 2125 and interpreted the
      rules as proscribing an unregulated action.

Caller's Arguments:

Arguments FOR: Basically, this depends on whether I was found guilty of
violating No Faking. If I was not, then G has interpreted the rules to
proscribe the collection of taxes as referee.
Arguments AGAINST: Similarly, if I am guilty, then no violation has
occurred.

Judge Janet's Arguments:

In CFJ 3403, H. Judge Tiger found that "interpreting the rules", for the
purpose of this clause in Rule 2125 is "reading the rules with the
expressed purpose of finding out what thy mean, and communicating this
through a well-defined, 'legal', process", rather than merely "offering
up 'I'd say it can be read to mean this'". This judgement was made in
light of Rule 478's former explicit protection of freedom of speech, but
I find that this holding remains good law and is consistent with the
current Rules.

Rule 2478/24 does not explicitly task the investigator of an infraction
with interpreting the Rules or even determining whether an infraction
has occurred at all. Instead, it is deliberately left to be platonically
determined whether the initial noting succeeded (as noting an infraction
can only succeed if an infraction has actually occurred). As such, I
find that, regardless of the comments that G. made during eir
investigation, e was not "interpreting the rules" for the purpose of
Rule 2125. Thus, no infraction could have been committed.

Judged FALSE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2125/13 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances
      under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action
      would, as part of its effect, modify information for which some
      player is required to be a recordkeepor.

      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules SHALL NOT be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2478/24 (Power=1.7)
Justice

      An Infraction is a violation of a rule. The person who committed
      an infraction is its infracter.

      The Investigator for an infraction is the Referee unless e is the
      infracter. Otherwise, it is the Arbitor.

      The Class of an infraction is 2 unless a rule specifies a
      different Class for it.

      The Base of an infraction is N, where N is the number of
      previously-investigated, unforgiven infractions that have been
      committed by the same person in the last 30 days. The previous
      notwithstanding, if the base of an infraction would be greater
      than its class, the infraction's base is equal to its class.

      Within 14 days of an infraction being committed, the Investigator
      CAN investigate the infraction by announcement, specifying a
      number of blots between the Base and the Class of the infraction,
      inclusive. When e does so, that many blots are created in the
      possession of the infracter.

      The previous notwithstanding, an Investigator CANNOT investigate
      an infraction that has already been investigated or forgiven. The
      Investigator of a noted, unforgiven infraction SHALL investigate
      the infraction in a timely manner after it has been noted;
      failure to do so is the Class N crime of Favoritism, where N is
      equal to the Class of the noted infraction.

      A player CAN, by announcement, "note" an unforgiven infraction
      committed by any other player in the last 7 days, specifying the
      incident and the rule it violates (or name of the Infraction if
      it has one).

      The Referee's weekly report contains a list of noted and
      investigated Infractions committed in the previous week.
