The “below message” quotes a pair of mime/multipart message constructed to 
contain multiple documents, many of which appear outside of the respective 
message’s sole text/plain part. I will explain the relevance of this 
observation below.

I had a look at each of Gaelan’s messages in multiple mail viewing 
systems.

In Apple Mail (my mailer of choice), Gaelan’s messages appear as ordinary 
email messages. The message titled ‘BUS: Intent’ appears to have the 
contents

The message titled ‘ BUS: [Proposal] Another Economy Fix Attempt’ appears 
to have the contents

There is no indication that either message contains multiple parts, or any 
indication that those parts might differ from the displayed part. The 
messages are displayed similarly in Mozilla Thunderbird, Gmail, Google 
Inbox, as well as both the mail-archive public archive of agora-business 
(https://www.mail-archive.com/agora-business@agoranomic.org/msg29760.html; 
the other is missing). In mail readers that provide access to the “raw” 
email message, the hidden parts can be discovered, but this is not an 
ordinary part of the mail-reading process for the overwhelming majority of 
users.

The Mailman archive of agora-business displays Gaelan’s messages 
differently. One is missing, but for the message that is present, the 
Mailman archive includes a warning that “a non-text attachment was 
scrubbed”, and provides a download link for the text/agora-action part of 
the message.

It is clear from experimentation that it takes exceptional effort to 
discover the portion of Gaelan’s messages contained in the 
non-“text/plain” portions of eir emails. It’s also likely, based on 
Gaelan’s subsequent actions, and on the specific actions e selected to 
include in the non-“text/plain” portions of eir emails, that Gaelan was 
relying on this exceptional effort to prevent Agorans from interfering 
with the execution of those actions by objecting. I personally believe 
that Gaelan intentionally hid those messages so that they would go 
unremarked until such time as e could finalize the intents they contain.

CFJ 1460 provides some guidance:

However, Gaelan’s “hidden” messages do not require any player to act on 
them, indirectly. They are

> I intend without objection to Win By Apathy, specifying myself.

and

> I intend to ratify the following document without Objection: {{ Gaelan 
has a black ribbon. }}

Under ordinary circumstances, an intent to perform an action without 
objection is effective, and can be resolved, whether or not any player 
takes any action with regards to the intent. Gaelan resolved both intents 
- and allegedly won the game, as well as ratifying a document affecting 
the Tailor’s report - in messages unambiguously understandable to the 
relevant players; only the action of announcing intention was done in 
“hidden” messages.

While the rules do not specifically define “an announcement of intent”, 
rule 478 (“Fora”) defines what it means to announce something:

> A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to all 
players and containing a clear designation of intent to be public. A rule 
can also designate that a part of one public message is considered a 
public message in its own right. A person "publishes" or "announces" 
something by sending a public message.

Note the use of “a clear designation of intent.” I hold that Gaelan’s 
messages were unclear.

The public forum in question was agora-business, an email mailing list, 
and as such technical and social norms around email must be considered 
when evaluating clarity. In particular, Gaelan’s emails deviated from RFC 
1341’s specification of the “multipart/alternative” MIME container format:

> The multipart/alternative type is syntactically identical to 
multipart/mixed, but the semantics are different. In particular, each of 
the parts is an "alternative" version of the same information.

This is clearly not the case; an intent to win the game is not “the same 
information” as an intent to destroy an Agency. Mail software, and mail 
users, rely on the expectation that multipart/alternative parts are 
interchangeable; this justifies common mail software’s decision to hide 
the non-text/plain parts of Gaelan’s original messages. By violating this 
expectation, Gaelan has reduced the clarity of eir messages.

Gaelan’s message was constructed such that ordinary mail clients would not 
afford eir users any reasonable opportunity to become aware of Gaelan’s 
“hidden” intentions. CFJ 1460’s logic remains compelling, but precedent 
must be expanded to address this situation. A message, or a portion of a 
message, that players would not reasonably have had an opportunity to 
discover also fails to communicate, and is without effect.

I find the statement "With the below message, Gaelan won by apathy.” to be 
FALSE.
