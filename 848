Arguments:

These need no arguments, all relivant info has spammed the PF over the period
of crisis.  I, in fact, have little oppinion on how these Statements should
be resolved and will offer no argumenrts other than to plead for a difinitive
and comprehensive judgement from the Judge on each of these so we can legally
end the indertermancy of the gamestate.

I would also ask interested parties to submit CFJs on the nature of the
Currency Transfers that initiated the crisis.  I, myself, have avoided the
issue and lack the knowledge to come up with a difinitve statement for
a CFJ.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I Judge this Statement to be TRUE. Although the Statement is not
exactly trivial, it is nevertheless ultimately tautologous, in my
opinion.

First, some facts about the time period in question. My thanks to
Kelly for providing this summary:

-> Morendil was delegated all vacant Offices by Swann Wed, 3 Jan 1996
-> 01:44:58 -0500; this constituted Banker, Clerk of the Courts, Herald,
-> Registrar, and Tabulator.  on Tue, 16 Jan 1996 22:40:15 -0500, Swann
-> redelegated CotC to Andre and Herald to Chuck; Morendil retained
-> Banker, Registrar, and Tabulator.  Morendil relinquished all
-> remaining Offices when e deregistered at Sun, 21 Jan 1996 17:58:22
-> +0100.

It had been my intention to list exhaustively - and probably exhaustingly
- everything Official that Morendil did during the period between Jan 3
and Jan 21. However, I have had difficulty obtaining this material, and
the deadline for Judgement draws nigh.

Fortunately, another approach occurs to me. Let us break the Statement
down into 3 parts:

1. All official duties conducted by Morendil as a result of Swann's
   legal delegations...

These, of course, constitute a large of number of acts. Morendil
produced a Registrar's Report, assigned a number of CFJs, and so on.
I think it safe to assume that these actions conducted by Morendil
were all conducted, at least partly, as a result of Swann's
delegations, and not, say, by coincidence. Morendil for much or all
of this period believed he was Speaker, of course, but he would not
have undertaken those actions had it not been clear that he was 
authorized to do so in both of the game states which were then being
debated.

It's important to note here that we don't have to worry about whether
Morendil performed any actions which he was not authorized to perform,
for example producing a document alleged to be a Promotor's Report.
Even if he had done so, such actions would not be relevant to this
Judgement, for they would not have been official actions. We are
concerned here only with those official actions which Morendil
performed.

2. ...were, indeed, official and legal...

It goes without saying that official actions are official. So much is
both trivial and tautologous. What about 'legal', though? Not all 
official actions are legal. Even when they are performed by a person
who is officially authorized to perform them, an official action can
be illegal in this sense: it can make a false allegation about the
game state. Examples of this would be: a CotC officially distributing
a CFJ in which the Judge has been selected from an incorrect list of
eligible Players, or a Promotor distributing something purporting to
be a Proposal which is not a Proposal. In fact, any official action
which might be subject to a COE - which is to say, all of them - could
serve as an example here. So, to Judge the Statement TRUE, it would
seem necessary to carefully check every action that Morendil performed
while delegated to ensure that it was factually correct. This is what
I had originally intended to do.

3. ...(excepting any errors in fact).

Fortunately, the final clause in the Statement makes such checking
unnecessary after all. If we except any errors in fact, the Statement
alleges nothing more than that Morendil was authorized to perform
all the actions he was authorized to perform. That *is* trivially
true, and hence so is the Statement.
