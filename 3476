Judge's Arguments

Given the evidence provided of CFJ 1895, I find a new answer to
question #1, which is that a person is a single organism and an
organism is a single person. I republish below edited versions of
question #2 and question #3 from my initial decision:

As to question #2, a common standard as to the sameness of persons is
the email address. However, it is possible that multiple persons share
a single email address. Therefore, this method is not fully successful
and therefore
I fall back upon the belief that we can only determine the sameness of
persons if they make statements to the effect of being the same or act
under the assumption that they are the same.

As to question #3, we can read the message from the email
the address used by the players in question and find that it is clearly
the belief of Zachary Watterson that he was previously a player.
However, it is unclear what his former nickname was. Given this and
the structure of the message, it seems as if the registration was
conditional upon not being a player. Therefore, if they are shown to
be the same person, then Zachary Watterson's player will have never
been registered. His current playership could be thrown into question
by the invalidity of the conditional. However, that is not the subject
of this CFJ. Given that we have no evidence specifying that the person
registering as Zachary Watterson believed that they had formerly
registered, specifically as the player, The Warrigal, we find that
there is no evidence specifying that the are the same person, but
there is also no evidence explicitly suggesting they aren't, therefore
this CFJ is UNDECIDABLE and I DISMISS it.
