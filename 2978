No conflict likely; in original version of Rights, it was meant (intent
of writer) that the Rules were implicitly an agreement; however it was
found in court that the Rules weren't an agreement as agreements were
defined.  Now, the "or Rules" clause in rights puts Rules and agreements
as two different things.

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

Tanner was already a player at the time of the message cited in
evidence.  Regardless of whether the ruleset is a "binding agreement",
refusing to become party is not the same as refusing to remain party.

I intend to become a player at this time. However, I refuse to become
party to any binding agreements at this time.
