JUDGEMENT 18 (Oerjan) Tue, 24 Aug 93, 16:00 PDT

STATEMENT:
Since 202 has not been repealed, the action of Andy Latto to increase
his score by 100 points was illegal. Andy Latto is therefore not The New
Amazing Speaker, and the game did not end because of Andy Latto's
declaring himself to get 100 points.
