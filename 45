Judgement 45 (Michael) Tue Sep 28 20:35:47 GMT 1993

When Proposal 367 passed, it had no affect on the ruleset whatsoever
because it claimed to amend a rule that at that stage did not exist
(namely 214, which had just been amended, hence replaced, by 364).
There is no such rule as 367. 

Judge: Vlad (accepted 28/9/93)

Judgement: TRUE

-----

Justification:

This was a little difficult, as there are two statements in the CFJ,
one referring to the past and one to the present. However, both in my
mind are true (the more so since 367 was repealed!).
