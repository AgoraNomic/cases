			ASSIGNMENT CFJ 809

Statement:  Rule 1493/1 should be interpreted such that when one Player
sends a legitimate message to the Tabulator requesting that a Win
Token be removed from a second Player and destroyed, and that second
Player has no Win Tokens in eir Treasury, that that second Player
comes to possess a negative number of Win Tokens.

History:
  Called by Kelly, October 11 1995, 09:36 EST5
  Assigned to Zefram, date unknown
  Judged FALSE by Zefram, October 18 1195, 02:28 +0100 (BST)

======================================================================

Argument:

Win Tokens are a Currency (R.1491).  The quantity of a Currency in a
given Treasury is permitted to be negative (R.1468).  A Transfer which
causes a Treasury to become negative is only permitted if it is a Type
I transfer; that is, a transfer which is required to take place
according to the Rules (R.1472).  The transfer of Win Tokens which
results when a Player sends a legitimate message to the Tabulator is a
Type I transfer, in that the transfer is required to take place
whenever the conditions specified in R.1493 arise.

Since the transfers initiated by R.1493 are Type I, they are permitted
to cause a Treasury to become negative, and therefore if a Player who
previously had zero Win Tokens in eir Treasury loses one as a
consequence of the application of R.1493, the Treasury of that Player
becomes negative at that time.

======================================================================

Requested Injunction:

The Judge is requested to enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1493
with the Statement of this CFJ.  The List of Relevant Rules (as
required by R.789) is: R.1491; R.1472; R.1493; R.1468.

======================================================================

Arguments Judge:

This case hinges on the Class of Win Token Transfers.  If they are
Class I transfers, then they can indeed cause people to have negative
numbers of Win Tokens.  If they are instead Class II or Class III
transfers, then they cannot cause people to have negative numbers of
Win Tokens.  Rule 1472/2 says:

      A transfer which is explicitly and directly required to take
      place by a Rule is initiated by that Rule, and is called a Class
      I Transfer.

      A transfer which is required to take place by an Entity (other
      than the Rules) to which the Rules have granted the power to
      require Currency Transfers to take place is initiated by that
      Entity (_not_ the Rule which grants that power to that Entity),
      and is called a Class II Transfer.

Win Token transfers are not explicitly required to take place by the
Rules.  The Rules merely grant the power to require these transfers to
Players.  Hence the transfers are Class II transfers.

The requested injunction is therefore denied.

======================================================================

Evidence:

Rule 1491/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Win Tokens and the Tabulator

      Let there be a Currency known as a Win Token. Any Player may
      possess any number of Win Tokens, which are created, destroyed,
      transferred, and otherwise manipulated only according to this
      and other Rules.

      The Recordkeepor for Win Tokens is the Tabulator. The Tabulator
      is responsible for keeping track of the status of Win Tokens. E
      shall post to the Public Forum at least once per Week, a report
      of the number of Tokens currently possessed by each Player, as
      well as a description of the changes since the previous report.
      Additionally, e shall make a report as soon as possible
      following a Win By Tokens.

      Upon creation of this Rule, all Players start with 0 Win Tokens. When a
      Player joins the Game, e starts with 0 Win Tokens. Whenever a
      Game ends (for any reason), all Win Tokens are destroyed.

Rule 1472/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Transfer of Currencies

      It shall be legal to transfer Currencies between Treasuries,
      provided this is done in accordance with the Rules.  Every
      transfer shall involve a positive amount of exactly one
      Currency, which shall be transferred from exactly one Treasury
      into exactly one other Treasury.  Every transfer has an
      initiator, which is the Entity which causes the transfer to take
      place.

      A transfer which is explicitly and directly required to take
      place by a Rule is initiated by that Rule, and is called a Class
      I Transfer.

      A transfer which is required to take place by an Entity (other
      than the Rules) to which the Rules have granted the power to
      require Currency Transfers to take place is initiated by that
      Entity (_not_ the Rule which grants that power to that Entity),
      and is called a Class II Transfer.

      A transfer which is not required to take place, and which is
      instead the consequence of a Player's action, is initiated by
      that Player, and is a called a Class III Transfer.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a Rule, or an Entity other than
      the Rules to which the Rules have granted the power to require
      Players to perform actions, which requires a Player to initiate
      a transfer is _not_ requiring the transfer.  Such a transfer is
      a Class III transfer initiated by that Player.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which would require a Player to
      initiate a transfer which is prohibited by this Rule.

      A Class I transfer is not permitted if there is no Rule which
      specifies a Player who is to detect and report the transfer.

      A Class II transfer is not permitted if there is no Rule, or
      Entity other than the Rules to which the Rules have granted the
      power to require Players to perform actions, which specifies a
      Player who is to detect and report the transfer.

      A Class II or Class III Transfer is not permitted if the
      Treasury from which the Currency is being transferred will
      possess a negative quantity of that Currency after the transfer
      has been completed.

      A Class III Transfer is not permitted unless the transfer is
      initiated by the Executor of the Owner of the Treasury from
      which the Currency is being transferred.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would permit a
      transfer prohibited by this Rule.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency must be notified of a transfer
      involving that Currency within seven days, unless another Rule
      specifies a different time limit for reporting a certain type of
      transfer.  For a Class I or Class II transfer, the notification
      shall be made by the Player required to detect and report it.
      For a Class III transfer, the notification shall be made by the
      Player who initiated it.

      Class I and Class II transfers take place at the time they are
      required to take place.  Class III transfers take place at the
      time they are reported.

Rule 1493/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Win Token Transfers

      During each Nomic Week, each Player not on Hold may make 0, 1,
      2, or 3 transfers of Win Tokens, in addition to any transfers
      permitted by default Currency Rules. These transfers occur when
      a Player sends a legitimate message to the Tabulator, requesting
      the transfer, which the Tabulator must record. The following are
      the only legitimate transfers, except that the default Currency
      Rules may permit other kinds of transfers as well:

      * 1 Token created and given to any Player, except the
      requesting Player.

      * 1 Token removed from any Player and destroyed.

      * 1 Token moved from any Player to any other Player except the
      Player making the transfer. This counts as two transfers.

Rule 1468/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of a Treasury

      A Treasury is a repository for holding Currencies.  Currencies
      may exist only within a Treasury.  A Treasury may contain a
      positive, negative, or zero quantity of a given Currency, unless
      otherwise prohibited by the Rules.  Currencies may be
      transferred between Treasuries only as specified in the Rules.

      Only those Nomic Entities which are authorized by the Rules to
      possess Treasuries may possess Treasuries.  No Treasury may be
      possessed by more than one Nomic Entity.  The possession of
      Treasuries may never be changed, once created.

      Each Player and each Group has a Treasury of its own.

      Whenever an Entity possesses only one Treasury, it shall be a
      permissible and unambiguous abbreviation to state that the
      Entity possesses the Currencies within its Treasury.

Rule 789/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules in the
      list of relevant Rules is changed in any way; or until a CFJ
      determines that the injunction no longer applies, as described
      below.  While it remains, it shall guide the application of that
      Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.
