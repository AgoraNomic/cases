Caller's Evidence:

The contract is as follows:

If you transfer one Green Mark to me, then I'll transfer one Green Mark to you
within 24 hours afterward.

The parties to this contract are Murphy and Levi


Upon making this agreement I transferred one green mark to Murphy in the

The contract has been violated by Murphy violating the time limit and color of
VC to be trasferred.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

I no longer have the Green Mark.  (I transferred it to comex just over
an hour after receiving it.)

I cannot acquire another Green Mark unless the rules change or someone
donates one.  (All Green Marks currently in existence were created by
the proposal that defined Marks.  There are no non-reporting offices,
except possibly Accountor per CFJ 1829.)

As most players have probably guessed by this point, I deliberately
arranged this situation (and CFJ 1811, and one more that has not yet
come to light) to give the equity court some test cases with low stakes
and a variety of circumstances.

Here are some potential judgements that come to mind:

  * Impose an agreement for comex to transfer a Green Mark to Levi.  Not
    allowed by Rule 2169 because comex is not a party to the original
    agreement.

  * Impose a new agreement for me to transfer a Green Mark to Levi.  Of
    course, I would have the same difficulty satisfying that agreement
    that I would have satisfying the original one; I would open myself
    to potential criminal prosecution, but really I've already done that
    by breaking the original agreement.

  * Impose an agreement for me to explicitly request that comex (or,
    failing that, some other player) transfer a Green Mark to Levi.

  * Impose an agreement for me to perform some other sort of Mark
    transfer to Levi.  Note that I already transferred a Blue Mark to
    Levi on December 5.

========================================================================

Judge pikhq's Arguments:

Of these, I think that the requirement to transfer some other sort of Mark is
the most equitable. Therefore, I make the following judgement:
"Murphy SHALL transfer a mark of some color he possesses as soon as possible.
To encourage em to do this, he MAY NOT do anything with eir marks aside from
fulfilling this until e *has* fulfilled this requirement.
None of Murphy's previous transfers count towards this obligation."
