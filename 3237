Caller's Arguments:

The "usual CFJ", despite being established in game custom,
doesn't have a standard phrasing, although there are some common ones.
("I am a player" or "Phlogistique is a player" are two plausible
wordings.) I'd say that the meaning of the statement of the CFJ is
unambiguous, but the exact statement of the phrasing is ambiguous. Does
that matter?

Judge omd's Arguments:

I'm going to have to disagree with G. in CFJ 3236 (though whether
that's my prerogative as judge of this case is debatable).  "The usual
CFJ." is not equivalent to "CFJ: The usual CFJ." - there is absolutely
no indication that it should be considered self-referential, and it
was clearly not intended as such.  It would be reasonable to transform
it to "I call the usual CFJ", but that doesn't call a CFJ on "The
usual CFJ." any more than "I submit a copy of my most recent proposal"
submits a proposal with the text "a copy of my most recent proposal".

I agree that it does not clearly identify a statement to be inquired
into, so no CFJ was created.  FALSE.
