Caller's Arguments:

In this situation, the Grantor may dispose of eir own holdings at any
time by revoking Power of Attorney first.

==========================================================================
Judge Crito's Arguments:

This CFJ is essentially the inverse of CFJ 1119 and I hereby enter a
judgement of TRUE.  I quote my reasoning from the appeal of CFJ 1119 to
support this judgement:

"...because the PoA Rules allow the grantor to revoke PoA at any time,
without warning or restriction, there is never a time during which the
grantor is actually unable to make use of eir assets, if e so desires.
It is this judges opinion that such an ability amounts to continuous
"effective control" over the assets in question."
