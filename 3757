Caller's Evidence:

Excerpt from Rule 2478 ("Vigilante Justice'):

>      When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
>      the allegation and CAN, in a timely fashion, SHALL conclude the
>      investigation by:
>            
>      - Imposing the Cold Hand of Justice on the perp, as described
>        elsewhere; or
>            
>      - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
>        be ILLEGAL or INEFFECTIVE to levy a fine for it, announcing the
>        Finger Pointing to be Shenanigans.


Excerpt from Rule 2557 ("Removing Blots"):

>      When the rules authorize an investigator to impose the Cold Hand
>      of Justice for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine on the
>      perp with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2x the base value of the
>      violation, within the following guidelines:
>            
>      - If the violation is described by the rules as a Class N crime,
>        then N is the base value; otherwise the base value is 2.
>            
>      - The fine SHOULD be reduced to the degree that the violation is a
>        minor, accidental, and/or inconsequential infraction.
>            
>      - The fine SHOULD be increased to the degree that the violation is
>        willful, profitable, egregious, or an abuse of an official
>        position.

Attempted imposition of the CHoJ by the Referee, R. Lee:

> This finger pointing is valid, I impose a fine on omd for failing to judge
> CFJ 3752 in the allotted time. The crime is tardiness which has a 2-blot
> base value, but given that the finger was pointed just a day after the time
> expired and I see no pattern of violations, I impose a fine of 1 blot.


Excerpt from Rule 2125:

>      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
>      permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under which
>      the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would, as part
>      of its effect, modify information for which some player is
>      required to be a recordkeepor.
>            
>      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
>      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
>      Rules for performing the given action.

Caller's Arguments:

    If the investigator of a Finger-pointing determines that a violation
    occurred, e certainly CAN impose the CHoJ under Rule 2478. The
    investigator, R. Lee, determined that a violation occurred in this
    instance, so e CAN impose the CHoJ.

    Because R. Lee is authorized to impose the CHoJ, under Rule 2557, e
    CAN levy a fine on omd.

    Levying a fine is a regulated action by Rule 2125. Thus, it can only
    be performed using the methods that the Rules explicitly specify.
    Rule 2557 does not explicitly specify a method by which a fine can
    be levied. The assets rules do not provide a general method of
    creating currencies, and Rule 2557 does not provide any method by
    which the fine can be levied. Thus, under Rule 2125, there is no way
    that levying a fine pursuant to the CHoJ can be performed, so R.
    Lee's attempt failed. omd was never fined a Blot, so e has none.
    This CFJ should be judged FALSE.
