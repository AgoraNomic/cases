Caller's Arguments:

First, the statement gives one possible set of winners, but I'd greatly
appreciate if the judge could opine on exactly which set of persons (if
any) won the game via tournament, and when they did so.  Note I am
talking about winning the game of Agora as per R2464, not "winning the
tournament".

R2464 states  "If a winner of a tournament is determined within 4 weeks
of its initiation, that person or persons win the game, otherwise the
tournament concludes with no winner."

The Tournament in question was created on 2-Jul-17 by the Herald, as
required by R2495.  The regulations (see Evidence) state that:

       The winner of this tournament shall be the person(s) who
       is/are able to gain the most karma, described below, over the
       course of the 4 week game.

However, the regulations further state that *after* the 4-week period,
the Herald will adjudicate various punishments (including potential 
karma deductions), then the Herald will "state" the winner.  There's two
ways to interpret that:

    a.  The tournament winner is "determined" immediately upon the
    conclusion of the 4-week period, and the Herald merely "states" it
    after the fact.  This means the tournament winners are also Agora
    winners.  The pause for punishment/appeals is no different than CFJs
    that can happen after the fact to determine past events.

    b.  The tournament has no "determined" winner until the Herald
    "states" the winner.  In which case this happens after the 4-week
    period, in which case R2464 blocks any actual winners by stating
    "the tournament concludes with no winners" immediately after the
    4-week period.

The Herald "stated" the winners, or at least attempted to do so, on
24-Aug-17 (message in Evidence).  However, the set of winners is also
unclear.  In the tournament regulations, the relevant clause is:

       All participants (people who have notified the Herald secretly
       of their intent to participate via a message addressed only to
       the Herald’s registered address and no other person) in this
       tournament CAN and SHALL be awarded the "Badge of Participation
       in the 2017 Birthday Tournament".  The winner of this tournament
       shall be the person(s) who is/are able to gain the most karma,
       described below, over the course of the 4 week game.

I assume from the Herald's 24-Aug announcement that the only two
"participants" to notify the Herald were G. and CuddleBeam, and that
no person gained any karma at all.  Given that only participants are
"able" to gain karma, are the winners are limited to persons who are
also participants?  Or all persons?  Also note that R2464 states that
Tournament regulations only have "binding control over those who freely
agree to play the tournament".

Rule 2464/1 (Power=1)
Tournaments

        A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned
        to be initiated as a tournament by the Rules.  If a winner of a
        tournament is determined within 4 weeks of its initiation, that
        person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament
        concludes with no winner. A Tournament is governed by a special temporary
        title of the ACORN, created in accordance with its parent rule,
        which have binding control over those who freely agree to play the tournament
        and over the tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these
        regulations cease to have any effect, and may be repealed by any player by
        announcement.

[Full tournament regulations, initiated 2-Jul-2017]

All participants (people who have notified the Herald secretly of their
intent to participate via a message addressed only to the Herald’s
registered address and no other person) in this tournament CAN
and SHALL be awarded the “Badge of Participation in the 2017 Birthday
Tournament”. The winner of this tournament shall be the person(s) who
is/are able to gain the most karma, described below, over the
course of the 4 week game.

Giving karma to another person may be done by sending a private [1]
notification to them including the code word and sending the code word
to the Herald. The person receiving the karma must send the
original code word and a separate code word to the Herald.

By giving karma, one gains 2 karma and by receiving karma, one gains 5
karma. One does not gain karma unless the person receiving karma accepts
it. No participant shall give karma more than 3 times in one
day [2] and no participant shall state in any publicly visible manner
[3] any actions that they have taken in regards to the game.

Any person believing the regulations have been violated MUST immediately
report such violations to the Herald. Any violations brought to the
attention of the Herald shall be investigated and handled in a
fair, documented, and equitable manner. The Herald may institute any
punishment, allowed by these regulations, decided through any means
after the conclusion of the investigation. No punishment for an
individual action shall exceed a deduction of 5 karma. However, the
Herald may remove participants or limit eir actions at eir discretion.
The Herald shall notify the player of the punishment immediately
if it is deemed that this would not impact gameplay. However, the Herald
may choose not to notify participants until the end of gameplay. At the
conclusion of the 4 week period, the Herald will carry out
any further investigatory work needed and will notify all players of
punishments with an option for appeals. After this period, the Herald
shall publicize all records pertaining to the game including, but
not limited to: investigation files, punishment logs, scoresheets, and
case logs. At that time, the Herald will also state the winner and award
Badges.

[1] A private notification is a notification that is sent only to an
individual person. Inclusion of the Herald as a recipient of this
message does not affect its status and for these purposes, the Herald
may always be a recipient of any message.

[2] A participant may attempt to give karma more times. However, all
attempts will be processed in the order in which the receiver’s messages
are received by the Herald and all attempts after the third
attempt will have no effect.

[3] A participant is considered to have stated a statement in a publicly
visible manner, if it has been communicated to an individual to whom the
information is not required to be communicated to by the
rules. No communication with the Herald is disallowed by this provision.
