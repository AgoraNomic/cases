======================================================================

Requested Injunction:

I request that Rule 1529 be annotated with a copy of the Statement.

======================================================================

Arguments:

First, the text of the relevant part of Rule 1529:

      The Compact of an Organization consists of either or both of the
      following elements:

         i) Statutes; defined as that collective text which is legally
            binding under the Rules, and must be obeyed by Players
            within the Compact's Jurisdiction as if it was a part of
            the Ruleset.


Rule 1529 contains a definition of Statutes. But definitions have two
different uses. They may be used to pick out what things will qualify
as instances of the concept defined, which I call the 'definitive'
use, and they may be used to indicate what properties a thing will
have which is already known (by other means) to be an instance of the
thing defined, which I call the 'descriptive' use.

This distinction is a real one, and is in use elsewhere in the Rules.
Consider, for example, Rule 206, which contains both uses:

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal...

      ...only those Entities designated by the Rules to be Voting
      Entities are Voting Entities. Players and Groups are Voting
      Entities.

The first sentence gives a decriptive definition: it says what
properties things will have which we have antecedently indentified as
a Voting Entity. The second sentence is a definitive definition: it
states what will qualify as an instance of a Voting Entity. (And
then the third sentence kicks in and gives two examples of things
which qualify as Voting Entities, and hence have the properties
ascribed to Voting Entities in the descriptive definition.)

Conflating these two uses quickly leads to confusion. In the case
of R.206, it would lead to the insistence that Players and Groups
are not really Voting Entities, since no Rule, apart from Rule 206,
says that Players and Groups are generally authorized by the Rules to
cast a vote or votes on a Proposal. But that is as unnecessary as it
is absurd: descriptive definitions are not intended to pick out
instances of the thing defined.

Similarly, in the case of Rule 1529, this conflation leads to
the insistence that no Organizations really have any Statutes,
since there is no Rule which says of a Group's Ordinances, or
of a Contest's Regulations, or of the Compacts of any other
kind of Organization, that they are collective texts which
are legally binding under the Rules. But that, too, is absurd
and unnecessary: other Rules, (specifically Rule 1533) tell
us how Compacts are created, and so pick out which things
are Compacts. The definition in Rule 1529 is clearly descriptive,
indicating that things antecedently known to be Statutes are
legally binding. Hence the Statement is TRUE.

======================================================================

Reasoning of the Judge:

The definition of Statutes in Rule 1529 is the only one in the Rules.
In fact, it is the only part of the Ruleset that states any of the
properties of Statutes at all.  The other uses of the word "Statute"
make use of it as a defined term.  Were it not for this use I might
consider the definition in Rule 1529 to merely be giving the label
"Statute" to certain Nomic Entities with the described properties.  But
this use requires that Statutes be defined.

Rule 1529 must therefore be taken as a definitive definition of
Statutes (to use the Caller's phraseology).  I judge this CFJ TRUE.

======================================================================

Injunction:

The CFJ having been judged TRUE, I make the following injunction:

The Rulekeepor shall annotate Rule 1529 with the statement of this
CFJ.

Evidence:

1. Rule 1529.
2. Rule 206.
3. Rule 1533.

Compacts: Statutes, and Warranties

      The Compact of an Organization consists of either or both of the
      following elements:

         i) Statutes; defined as that collective text which is legally
            binding under the Rules, and must be obeyed by Players
            within the Compact's Jurisdiction as if it was a part of
            the Ruleset.

        ii) Warranties; defined as that collective text which requires
            Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction to either obey
            it or suffer penalties defined within the Rules or the
            Compact.

      A Compact may only possess those elements allowed it by the
      Rules defining its Class of Organization.  If these Rules do not
      specify, the Compact may only consist of Statutes.

----- 2. Rule 206 -----

Rule 206/5 (Mutable, MI=1)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to
      be a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a
      Proposal unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities
      designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
      Entities. Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary. The casting of any votes in
      addition to an Entity's first vote may only be achieved by the
      casting of Extra Votes, if that is permitted, as specified in
      other Rules.

----- 3. Rule 1533 -----

Rule 1533/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creation of Organizations, and Their Compacts

      Organizations (and, simultaneously, their initial Compacts) are
      created in the following manner:

      A set of Players, known as the Foundors, sends a message to the
      Notary containing the following information:

         i) The Class of the created Organization.
        ii) The Unique Name of the particular Organization being
            created.
       iii) The inital Compact for the proposed Orginization.
        iv) Any information required by Rules governing that specific
            Class of Organization.

      The Organization is created and is in force once the Notary
      receives the above information from all required Foundors.

      The set of required Foundors is specified within the Rules
      defining the particular Class of Organization, but they must be
      from within the Jurisdiction of the new Organization's Compact.
      Additional restrictions on the set of Foundors can be made by
      those Rules.

      This Rule defers when other Rules specifically claim precedence
      over its requirements. Otherwise, these requirements take
      precedence.
