			JUDGEMENT CFJ 857

" The Rule that was created by Proposal 2448 should be interpreted so

======================================================================

Reasons & Arguments:

The relevant Rule mentions that these Transfers occur 
when the Player casts a Vote, not a _legal_ Vote. The other Rule in 
the Ruleset which calls for a transfer resulting from the casting of 
Votes on a Proposal is 312, which _does_ use the term "legal Vote".  

On the other hand, the Threat Wins Rule only says that the action of 
casting a particular number of Votes results in a transfer, though it 
specifies neither a limit to the time period during which such an 
action should be undertaken nor the time of occurrence of these 
transfers.

It is therefore my interpretation that Votes which are cast on 2448, 
even if they are not legal, may result in the transfer occurring at 
the time the message casting such Votes is sent.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

My decision on CFJ 857 is FALSE.

Reasoning: Votes are platonic. There is no "Vote" if it is not a "legal
Vote". Therefore in Proposal 2448, "Vote" can only be taken to mean "legal
Vote".
