Called by Murphy:                       05 Jul 2012 04:21:07 GMT
Assigned to ais523:                     06 Jul 2012 13:43:52 GMT

Caller's Arguments:

The underlying data (Thunderbird: View -> Message Source; presumably
most other mail readers have something comparable) is
=F0=9F=8C=9C=F0=9F=8F=81=F0=9F=95=97: =F0=9F=8E=A9=E2=9D=93

Googling F09F8C9C, F09F8F81, F09F9597, F09F8Ea9, and (E29D93 Unicode)
leads to (respectively)

Gratuitous Arguments by ehird:

If this is judged TRUE, I will deregister.

Judge ais523's Arguments:

Regardless of whether the message has the right form to initiate a CFJ
or not (I think it might do, the effort required to decode it is not too
extreme), it doesn't contain a statement (the characters that appear
after the colon cannot reasonably be parsed as a statement).

As such, I judge CFJ 3243 FALSE. CFJ 3242 doesn't exist, but just in
case, I attempt to judge it MALFORMED (and note that it's impossible to
actually correctly judge a CFJ MALFORMED, as all CFJs for which it's
appropriate don't exist).
