Caller's Arguments:

Under R2075, Champion is awarded to the Player who wins the game.  Under
past rules, Champion was awarded to a Player who had held the
then-defined Patent Title of Current Champion, and a different Player
then won the game.

I submit to the Court that the current Patent Title of Champion serves a
distinct purpose from the former Patent Title of Champion, and it should
be tracked independently.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 2075/0 (Power=1)
Winning Hands

      The Deckmastor's Budget shall contain between one and three
      Winning Hands, each of which is a list of cards with a hand size
      at least two greater than the Maximum Hand Size.

      If a Gambler's Hand is identical to a winning hand at any
      particular moment, any Gambler has 72 hours from that moment to
      announce that a Gambler holds or has held a winning hand.

      If the announcement is false, the Deckmastor shall, as soon as
      possible, transfer 1 card at random from the announcing
      Gambler's Hand to the Deck.

      If the announcement is true, the holding Gambler Wins the Game,
      and is awarded the boon of Pokerface and the defined regular
      Patent Title Champion.

      Exactly one week after a true announcement, the Flux of all
      Gamblers except the Deck shall become frozen.  The Deckmastor
      shall transfer random cards from the hands of each frozen
      gambler to the deck, until each frozen gambler has either (a) a
      hand size equal to or less than the Minimum hand size or (b) no
      cards.  Then, the Deckmaster shall deal cards to the winner up
      to the maximum hand size.  When these tasks have been peformed,
      the Flux of every Gambler shall become free.

      If no one has won the game in the last six months, then any
      Gambler may announce a Skunk, which shall trigger the effects of
      a true announcement of a win above, except that no boon shall be
      awarded nor shall extra winner's be dealt.

========================================================================

Judge RedKnight's Arguments:

Rule 649 Defines a Patent Title as a legal item of recognition of a person's
distinction.  I note that both the "current" title Champion and the "old"
title Champion both fit this description.  Thus it appears there is no
difference between the two.  Therefore I judge this CFJ FALSE.

========================================================================

Judge RedKnight's Evidence:

Rule 649/15 (Power=1)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item of recognition of a person's
      distinction.

      When a Patent Title is awarded to a person, that person
      is said to Bear that Patent Title; the Patent Title is Borne
      by the person, and the person is its Bearor.  When a Patent
      Title is revoked from a person, that person ceases to Bear that
      Patent Title.  The status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be
      changed as explicitly set out in the Rules. Only persons may
      Bear Patent Titles.

      As soon as possible after a Patent Title award or revocation
      which occurs automatically occurs, the Herald shall publicly
      announce that such an award or revocation has occurred, and
      which Title has been awarded to or revoked from which person or
      persons.

      Significance is a stuck switch for Patent Titles with states
      Historical, Hysterical, and Ephemeral.  The Herald may, Without
      Objection, cause a Title be switched from Historical
      Significance to Hysterical Significance.
