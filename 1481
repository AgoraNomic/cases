==============================  CFJ 1481  ==============================

    A Player's score is deemed to change at the time a Scorekeepor is
    notified of a scoring event, not at the time of the scoring event
    itself.

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1929 reads:
      The Rules may specify that certain events may cause a certain
      Player to be Awarded Points (causing eir Score to be increased)
      or Penalized Points (causing eir Score to be decreased). If said
      event occurs, then any Player may notify the Scorekeepor of the
      Award or Penalty. The Scorekeepor shall then note the change in
      the affected Player's Score.

This contains a self-contradiction.  On one hand, this rule explicitly
states that "certain events" are what "cause" a Player to be awarded
points.  If the event is what causes the change, than the change should
be deemed to happen at the time of the event, even if the notification
that allows the change to be recorded comes later.  On the other hand,
as the change may not be recorded unless the Scorekeepor is notified,
the Rule implies that the change occurs when both requirements are met;
that is the time of the notification.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1929/7 (Power=1)
Points

      A Player's Score is a measure of that Player's unloserliness,
      measured in Points. The Score of each Player is at all times an
      integer. A Player who has not been Awarded or Penalized since
      the last Team Win has a Score of zero Points.

      The Rules may specify that certain events may cause a certain
      Player to be Awarded Points (causing eir Score to be increased)
      or Penalized Points (causing eir Score to be decreased). If said
      event occurs, then any Player may notify the Scorekeepor of the
      Award or Penalty. The Scorekeepor shall then note the change in
      the affected Player's Score.

      Such a notification must meet the following requirements, else
      it is ineffective:
         -- It must be sent within 7 days of the event
         -- It must unambiguously describe the event
         -- It must indicate the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty
         -- It must be the first valid notification for that specific
            event

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is invalid and points do not change.

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is not
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is valid and points change.  If the notification is challenged
      later, then the player may be penalized/awarded a number of
      points equal to the original award/penalty.

========================================================================

Judge root's Arguments:

I accept the caller's arguments as correct.  In addition, I find further
support from the later part of Rule 1929, where it reads:

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is not
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is valid and points change.  If the notification is challenged
      later, then the player may be penalized/awarded a number of
      points equal to the original award/penalty.

In the case that the event did not actually occur, then the time of the
award could not possibly be the time of the event, and so the time of the
notification must be used.  Thus, if R1929 is to be considered at all
consistent regarding timing, it must follow that legitimate score changes
happen at the time of notification as well.

Therefore, I judge CFJ 1481 to be TRUE.
