Caller's Arguments:

According to Rule 1755:
      When a player becomes deregistered or a Zombie, e ceases to be
      a candidate, officer, judge, or in general to occupy any role or
      position to which a Rule assigns any duties or powers.  No one
      who is not registered, or who is a Zombie, may occupy such a
      role or position.  This rule takes precedence over rules which
      would prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position.

      The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the Bearing of Patent
      Titles, or any position which a Rule specifically says may be
      held by a non-Player or Zombie, nor shall it act to prevent a
      non-Player or Zombie from registering, calling CFJs, or doing
      things that non-Players and Zombies are generally able to do.

According to Rule 101:
      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in
      effect, in the form in which they are currently in effect.

Abiding by the Rules is thus a duty of Players.  `Player' is thus, by
1755, a position that may not be held by Zombies.

Although Rule 1755 states ``The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to
. . . any position which a Rule specifically says may be held by a
non-Player or Zombie'', this clause is not applicable here.  Although
Rule 1042 states that ``Any Player can make a Silent Player a Zombie
by . . . .'', it does not specify that Zombies remain Players; nor
do any other Rules.  Thus the Rules do not specifically say that the
position of `Player' may be held by a Zombie.

Furthermore, Rule 1884 states that ``Zombies are Property''.  In
addition, it is Agoran custom that Players are individuals, rather
than `Avatars' or such.  Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights states:
  No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave
  trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.

Thus, if Zombies are permitted to be Players, Agora may be in
violation of a U.N. General Assembly resolution, not to mention the
laws of several countries of which Players are citizens.  While this
does not actually establish that Zombies may not be Players, it does
indicate that ``the best interests of the game'' (R217) is against
Zombies being Players.

Judge root's Arguments:

Crito's arguments have convinced me.

I find Caller neil's arguments to be complete and correct, and
I therefore Judge the statement TRUE.

The counterargument seems to be that R1042 causes a Player to *become* a
Zombie, and then R1755 causes the Zombie to cease being a Player.

Appellant Crito's Arguments:

Good point.  I was focusing so much on R1042 that I missed that part of R1755.
Thanks, Steve.  In that case, I also call for the appeal of CFJ 1316.
