Rule 478/36
Fora [Excerpt]

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously and
      clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.


Rule 2577/2
Asset Actions [Excerpt]

      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
      by its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
      backing document.


Rule 2483/13
Economics

      Coins are the official currency of Agora and are tracked by the
      Treasuror. They can be owned by Agora, players, and contracts.
            A player CAN win the game by paying a fee of 1,000 Coins.


Caller's Arguments:

Per Rule 2577, "an asset generally CAN be transferred [...] by 
announcement by its owner", and Rule 2438 does not modify this general 
statement at all. Therefore, a Coin can be transferred by announcement by 
its owner.

Transferring D. Margaux's Coins is an action defined by the Rules that 
'CAN be performed "by announcement"' (even if the intent is only that it 
CAN be performed by announcement by a single person), satisfying the first 
criterion in Rule 478.

I believe that I have unambiguously and clearly specified the action of 
transferring 500 of D. Margaux's Coins, and I have announced that I 
perform that action. Therefore, under Rule 478, I have performed that 
action, so, in this message, I transferred at least one Coin.

I believe this CFJ should be judged TRUE.

Judge G.'s Arguments:

In the R478 text:

>     Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
>     announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously and
>     clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.

This is a method definition, which maps a shorthand method ("by
announcement") onto a series of discrete, naturally-doable steps (given 
the prior definition on R478 of fora and public messages) for performing 
the action.

The problem with this definitional text is that the grammatical constructs
are mixed. The first part is in passive voice ("CAN be performed") while
the second part is in active voice ("a person performs").  This is a
grammatical error and should be fixed, either by making both active or
both passive (either would be fine and match the intent of this clause).

However, until it is fixed, how can we parse the text?  In particular, the
caller assets that this error is substantive and maps the subject of the
second clause ("a person", by which the caller means "any person") onto
any use of the term being defined ("by announcement"), even if an actual
use case specifies a more limited set of subjects (i.e. a more limited set
of persons who CAN perform the action).

However, the important thing is that the word "performs" in this context 
is not in itself ENABLING.  The CAN is enabling.  In R2152 we see:

      5. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.

in relation to this:
       An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
       by its owner

The fact that the CAN for the transfer is specifically assigned to its
owner means that attempts by other persons are unsuccessful.

I find FALSE.
