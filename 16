JUDGEMENT 16 (Oerjan) Tue, 24 Aug 93, 16:00 PDT

STATEMENT:
I include proposal 383 for your reference:
----
PROPOSAL

Repeal of 308

Rule 202, as amended by rules 302 and 308, is hereby repealed.
----
Whereas, there exists a Nomic rule 202, this rule is not amended
by rules 302 and 308.
Therefore, the phrase 'Rule 202, as amended by rules 302 and 308' does
not refer to Nomic rule 202.
So I call for judgement on the following statement:

Proposal 383 does not repeal Nomic rule 202.
