Caller's Arguments:

Arguments AGAINST: None of the elections contain a "tally" of the voters'
valid ballots, which is necessary for the resolutions to be EFFECTIVE. The
lists of players and their ballots have no sums, and are not even grouped
by what each ballot is, which is hardly a tally.

CFJ 1710 very clearly sets a precedent that a tally is a sum:
https://github.com/AgoraNomic/cases/blob/6cd01d92c5513424dbe585687357b35d34c80e6d/1710

Notes: The resolutions also do not evaluate conditionals and have incorrect
values for the numbers of ballots each candidate received, which
additionally aren't clearly labelled. G. was not explicitly eliminated in
the PM election while Jason and Murphy were, though explicit elimination is
regulated here and wasn't actually necessary in any election here:

         In case multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes
         at any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
         option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices in
         the next M stages would result in the same set of options being
         eliminated, e need not specify the order of elimination.

CFJ 1822 seems to contradict CFJ 1710 as it calls a collection of ballots a
tally without there being a sum, but the relevant collection (
https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/2007-December/008430.html)
differs from these elections in that Murphy listed Voter-vote pairs, while
BobTHJ listed Vote - (List of Voters) pairs. The latter is more tally-like,
as you could convert each name to tally marks, and you'd have an easy
tally. CFJ 1822:
https://github.com/AgoraNomic/cases/blob/6cd01d92c5513424dbe585687357b35d34c80e6d/1822

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Jason's Arguments:

The caller's arguments hinge on whether a listing of ballots can qualify
as a "tally of the voters' valid ballots" under Rule 208.

"Tally" is not defined in the rules, so it has its natural language
meaning. Here are definitions of the wood from various sources:

Google built-in dictionary: "a current score or amount /  a record of a
score or amount / a particular number taken as a group or unit to
facilitate counting"

Dictionary.com: "an account or reckoning; a record of debit and credit,
of the score of a game, or the like"

Merriam-Webster online: "a recorded reckoning or account / a device for
visibly recording or accounting especially business transactions"

Wikipedia: "tally commonly refers to counting or to summation of a total
amount, debt, or score"

These definitions are split on whether counting is a necessary component
of a tally. Two of the definition provide for a "reckoning" or
"account", both of which could include the process and work of coming to
a total, but need not necessarily include a raw count (for instance, by
these definitions it appears that summing all deposits and withdraws
from an account could be a "tally", without necessarily counting the
transactions themselves). However, the idea of counting or summing
something does appear to be a common element.

However, the meaning of the word in an Agoran context may be constrained
by precedent.

CFJ 1710 [0] found the following:

> The word "tally" is not defined by the rules, and the various
> dictionaries consulted seem to describe this as a sum of the votes,
> not a complete accounting thereof. This would indicate that an
> accurate sum, even if accompanied by an inaccurate list of votes,
> would be sufficient to satisfy condition (d).

CFJ 1822 [1] found the following [2] would have had a valid tally (and
purported to be for the purposes of self-ratification), but for
including listing a player incorrectly:

> AGAINT: OscarMeyr
>
> Result: APPROVE
> (Note: The votes for DSPBCORMKPYOAFA and AGAINT are invalid as these

Finally, CFJ 3723 [3] found that the following was a "complete and
accurate" "tally":

Notably, neither of the two listings that were explicitly called out as
either valid or successfully purporting to be a valid tally contain
explicit counts of ballots (the latter contains a count only of voting
strength FOR, not ballots FOR).

I find that the more recent precedents of 1822 and 3723 are controlling
and at least somewhat consistent with the natural language meaning of
the term "tally". Evaluating conditional votes and collecting all of the
votes into a one or more lists in a single message is still "summation",
in the sense that it forms a summary, and forms an "account" of the
ballots in the decision. Thus, the purported resolutions meet the tally
requirement of item 4 of Rule 208 (provided the lists of votes are
correct, which has not been disputed).

That the purported resolutions were published after the voting period
ended, that they clearly identified the matters to be resolved, that
they specified correct lists of voters, and that they specified the
correct outcomes have not been disputed. The resolutions were therefore
effective. Therefore, when the decisions were resolved, the specified
players won the elections and were installed into the appropriate offices.

Judged TRUE.


Judge Jason's Evidence:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 208/14 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to
      be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after
      the end of the voting period. To be EFFECTIVE, such an attempt
      must satisfy the following conditions:

      1. It is published after the voting period has ended.

      2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      3. It specifies the number of voters (or a list of the voters).
         For these purposes and for determining quorum, a "voter" is
         someone who submitted a ballot on the decision that was valid
         when it was submitted and also valid (i.e. not withdrawn or
         otherwise invalidated) at the end of the voting period.

      4. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if there
         was more than one valid option, provides a tally of the voters'
         valid ballots.

      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting to
      the initiator of the decision. If the vote collector is defined by
      reference to a position (or, in the default case, if the initiator
      was so defined), then the vote collector is the current holder of
      that position.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.
