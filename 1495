History:

Called by Taral:                        02 Apr 2004 17:30:30 GMT
Assigned to Elysion:                    03 Apr 2004 03:05:03 GMT
Judged TRUE by Elysion:                 04 Apr 2004 19:07:42 GMT

========================================================================

Judge Elysion's Arguments:

Rule 1941/2 (Fees) reads in part:

      To perform a fee-based action, a Player (the Actor) who is
      otherwise permitted to perform the action must announce that e
      is performing the action and announce that there is a fee for
      that action. Upon said announcement, the action is performed,
      the Actor's kudos are decreased by the fee, and Agora's kudos
      are increased by the fee.

At the time in question, Eris was legally permitted to raise eir Lobbying
Strength by rule 2064/0 (Potency and Lobbying). Further, the email in
question satisfies the criteria for announcing eir action.

The real issue Eris apparently wants judgement on is whether e spent 1 or 2
kudos to make emself immaculate; however, under rule 1941 the number of
kudos held when performing a fee-based action is relevant only when there is
a challenge to the action. At the time of this CFJ, though, no such challenge
had been made on the action in question.

Thus, since the email satisfies the requirements of rule 1941/2 and has not
been challenged, I must judge the statement TRUE. (As an aside, if Eris were
to challenge the action and resubmit this CFJ, then by this judge's best
determination e will have established the circumstances necessary to test eir
intended statement.)

I flip my role to Politician.

I pay a fee of 6 kudos to increase my Lobbying Strength by 3.

Rule 2064/0 (Power=2)
Potency and Lobbying

      Each Player has two associated non-negative integral numbers
      known as that Player's Potency and Lobbying Strength.

      A Player's Potency is equal to the sum of the Lobbying Strengths
      of the members of eir Coalition.

      At any time, a Player may, by announcement, increase their
      Lobbying Strength by a positive integral amount, N. The Fee
      associated with this action is the Political Charge multiplied
      by N, or half that amount (rounded up) if the Player is a
      Politician.

      At the beginning of each new month, every Player's Lobbying
      Strength is set to 1. Whenever a Player registers, eir Lobbying
      Strength is set to 1.
