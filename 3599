===============================  CFJ 3599  ===============================

      If a proposal specifies an amendment to a rule consisting of
      multiple parts, one of which is a title change, then the entire
      amendment fails.

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 105 is clear that amendments and title changes are
different kinds of rule changes. Moreover, rule changes must also occur
sequentially; thus it is impossible to simultaneously amend and retitle a
rule. Consequently, I think that a proposal that attempts to specify such
an amendment fails to do anything, by virtue of the "any ambiguity...
causes that change to be void" clause.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge o's Arguments:

FALSE, in general, but it’s possible to write a proposal whose effects 
terminate at the title change, as alleged by the caller. The proposal in 
question happens not to be an example of such a proposal.

Rule 105 (“Rule Changes”) governs:
>      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can, as
>      part of its effect,
>       …
>      4. amend the text of a rule.
>
>      5. retitle a rule.

Furthermore, those changes must happen separately:
>      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
>      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

It’s clear from the text of the rule that there are no hybrid effects, as 
“retitle a rule and change its text” is not one of the kinds of rule changes 
permitted by that rule. However, when determining the rule to which a change 
applies, rule 105 is liberal:
>      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
>      change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
>      in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
>      for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.

In other words, where a change is _not_ ambiguous, it can (and will be, if 
otherwise valid) applied. Changing the title of a rule does not render the 
rule unidentifiable, and it is entirely unambiguous to interpret a proposal 
such as

        Change the rule titled “X” as follows:

                1. Change its title to “Y”
                2. Change its text to “New-Text”

as applying two distinct changes, in sequence, without interruption due to the 
change of title. The specification does not become instantly ambiguous; we can 
continue to identify the single rule whose title was X prior to the 
application of the proposal if it was unambiguous at that time, and the entire 
sequence fails if it was not.
