Thank you, omd, for fixing this. I'll be interested to hear your theories.

This is an infernal mess as far as the gamestate is concerned. According 
to precedent, messages that aren’t received by a substantial number of 
players haven’t been validly sent via the fora. As a test case to see if 
we’e gonna apply those precedents here, I CFJ "Proposal 8277 identifies a 
distributed proposal."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge omd's Arguments:

Per Rule 2034, the message resolving Proposal 8277 [1] has
self-ratified as an attestation to certain statements, including that
"such a proposal existed".  Per CFJ 3449, that ratifies the listed
properties of the proposal, which in this case includes the ID number
8277 itself.  According to Rule 1607 only distributed proposals have
ID numbers.  Thus, if Proposal 8277 was not actually distributed, the
minimal modification to the gamestate "to make the ratified document
as true and accurate as possible" would be to establish a legal
fiction that Proposal 8277 was distributed.

Note that I long assumed that the past was not part of the "gamestate"
at all, and could not be altered by ratification.  Instead, I assumed
that ratification merely altered the present gamestate to 'what it
would be' under a hypothetical timeline where the ratified document
was true.  Under that interpretation, ratification wouldn't affect the
outcome of any pending CFJs, because it wouldn't change "the facts and
legal situation at the time the inquiry case was initiated" (R591).
It also wouldn't affect CFJs that explicitly refer to the past.
However, these days we have a precedent that ratification does create
legal fictions about the past.  Presumably these should be used
wherever the Rules inquire about the past; I see no exception for
CFJs.

TRUE.

Hopefully the other CFJ lets me resolve the *real* question.
