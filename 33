The tallies for Proposals 440 through 446, inclusive did not reflect
all of the properly cast votes for those Proposals, and should be
re-tallied after all the properly cast votes have been accounted for.

---
Rule 415 requires the Speaker to distribute Proposals in the order that he
receives them.

The explanation and justifications have been repeated enough that we don't
think that they need to be stated yet again...

JUDGE
Joe Lindsay <lindsay@cs.wisc.edu>

[Clerk Comments:  Uh oh, I think Joe is another 'phantom player'; his
 score has been zero for a *long* time.  It may be a while yet before
 we get this judged...]

{ Joe was adjudged to have left the game, and was replaced by Jim Shea
on 16/9/93. }

> 
> 109.  The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a number for
>       reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule Change
>       proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive
>       integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.
> 
> In other words, if a proposal is properly submitted to the
> Speaker and meets all requirements of a valid proposal, its
> number must be the next successive integer available at that
> time.  415 requires the Speaker to "assign the proposal a number
> *and* distribute the proposal" [emphasis mine], which I interpret
> to mean that assigning the number and distributing the proposal
> are a single atomic act. Since e must assign numbers in the order
> of receipt, the Speaker must likewise distribute proposals in
> that order.
