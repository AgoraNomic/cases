======================================================================
                      JUDGEMENT OF CFJ 862

  The Rules in general should be interpreted such that a Win Token 
  Transaction as described in Rule 1493 can cause a Player's Win Token 
  holdings to be negative.

======================================================================

Judge:          Zefram
Judgement:      TRUE

Caller:         Morendil
Barred:         
On Hold:        Blob, Doug

Eligible:       Andre, Chuck, Coren, dcuman, elJefe, favor, 
                Jtael, Kelly, KoJen, Michael, Murphy, Steve,
                Swann, Vanyel, Zefram

Note: Zefram earns a Judicial Salary, which will be reported at
the proper time.

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, Wed, 27 Mar 1996 02:16:25 +0100
  Assigned to Zefram, Wed, 27 Mar 96 06:43:59 PST
  Judged TRUE by Zefram, Sat, 30 Mar 1996 03:37:33 +0000 (GMT)

======================================================================

Caller's Argument:

         I believe Rules 1472 and 1493 are sufficiently amended
from their form at the time the (IMHO ill-considered) Judgement of
CFJ 809 was made that the question ought to be reconsidered. WTTs
are no longer Currency Transfers, so 1472 cannot prohibit negative
WT holdings anymore.

-[Morendil]-
Misspelled?  Impossible.  My modem is error correcting.

======================================================================
Decision of Judge Zefram:  TRUE

Rule 1493 itself leaves open the possibility of negative Win Tokens by
not explicitly considering the case.  As there is no general Rule
prohibiting negative holdings of Currencies, and no specific Rule
prohibiting negative holdings of Win Tokens, it is indeed possible for
WTTs to result in negative WT holdings.

I note that even if WTTs were Currency Transfers, and hence governed by
Rule 1472, it would still be possible to have a negative number of
WTs.  Rule 1472 does not actually prohibit negative Currency holdings,
but is rather a definition of a Currency Transfer.  Rule 1472 in fact
does not explicitly permit any types of Currency Transfer, but requires
that some other Rule permit a type of Currency Transfer for it to be
legal.
