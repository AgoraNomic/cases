========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 2158 states, in part:
{{{
      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its judge
      has violated a time limit to assign a judgement to it, the Clerk
      of the Courts SHALL recuse that judge with cause by announcement
      as soon as possible; however, this requirement is waived if the
      judge assigns a judgement to it first.
}}}
"As soon as possible" means within 7 days, so the CotC is late on this
recusal.

Note that it is entirely possible to recuse an appeals panel; rule 1868
defines recusal in a general way that is entirely capable of applying to
judicial panels as well as to players. (Note that recusing a judicial panel
with cause does not cause it to become supine, due to the wording of rule
1871.)

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

The judicial panel of comex, Pavitra, and pikhq is the judge on appeal 1936a;
the judgement on that case is now over 11 days overdue (the case became
applicable and open on 22 May 2008, meaning a judgement was required on or
before 29 May 2008). Murphy is the CotC.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

It's a fair cop.  I eventually recused the
panel in question about 8 days after my time limit for doing so; I ask
that the severity of the sentence match the severity of the offense.

========================================================================

Judge OscarMeyr's Arguments:

Defendant Murphy practically admitted to the action in question.  I
trivially rule GUILTY.

I don't see much harm having been caused by this action, so I
sentence ninny Murphy to APOLOGY.  If nobody raises a fuss over a non-
standard sentence, then in place of the list of prescribed words I
order Murphy to write eir apology in the format of a sonnet, using
eir choice of a rhyme scheme generally accepted for sonnets.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Murphy:

How slow is triple unanimity!
    That lofty goal of undisputed truth
        That three must reach in no more time than one.
And so the order handed down to me:
    Recuse the lot if they be so uncouth
        That none persuade the rest before the gun.
But I was lost, the cases like a sea;
    Extended kindness, as if to a youth
        And gave them extra time to judge and run.
Apologies, I register a plea:
                        No fun.

As I'm sure all of us would consider it unreasonable to cram the
200-word-apology minimum entirely into sonnet form, I fill out the
requirement by quoting from Wikipedia's description of the unusual
form selected:

  The curtal sonnet is a form invented by Gerard Manley Hopkins, and
  used in three of his poems.

  It is an eleven-line (or, more accurately, ten-and-a-half-line)
  sonnet, but rather than the first eleven lines of a standard sonnet it
  consists of precisely 3/4 of the structure of a Petrarchan sonnet
  shrunk proportionally. The octave of a sonnet becomes a sestet and the
  sestet a quatrain plus an additional "tail piece." That is, the first
  eight lines of a sonnet are translated into the first six lines of a
  curtal sonnet and the last six lines of a sonnet are translated into
  the last four and a half lines of a curtal sonnet. Hopkins describes
  the last line as half a line, though in fact it can be shorter than
  half of one of Hopkins's standard sprung rhythm lines. In the preface
  to his Poems (1876-89), Hopkins describes the relationship between the
  Petrarchan and curtal sonnets mathematically; if the Petrarchan sonnet
  can be described by the equation 8 + 6 = 14 then, he says, the curtal
  sonnet would be:

  12/2 + 9/2 = 21/2 = 10 1/2
