Caller's Arguments:

The Rules are unclear as to when a Player becomes a Justice on a Board of
Appeals.  Rule 911 reads, in part:

      When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected in order to reach a decision about the consideration
      mandated by the appeal.

We might take this to mean that the selected Players become Justices at the
time they are selected.  However, how can we determine the time at which this
selection happened?  There is no practical way to determine at what precise
moment the CotC (or Justiciar) selected the Justices in an appeal.

The wording of Rule 911 might be taken to mean that the selection occurs at
the
instant that the appeal is initiated, but this is ridiculous, as the CotC
cannot realistically select Justices at that instant, especially since the
selection may involve a random determination.

Rule 1570 reads, in part:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall make an announcement in the Public
      Forum as soon as possible after an Appeal has been initiated,
      including in eir announcement the matter of consideration of the
      Appeal and the identity of the Justices selected to serve on the
      Board of Appeals and which (if any) of these Players are
      ineligible to fill the positions to which they have been
      assigned.

My theory, then, is that the appointment of Justices to a Board of Appeals
takes place at the time of the first valid announcement indicating the Players
selected to serve.  If Murphy is found not to be a Justice, then this would
mean that Justiciar OscarMeyr's announcement was invalid, and so Goddess Eris
and OscarMeyr are not yet Justices and have not submitted their findings.

Judge Sir Toby's Arguments:

        The court agrees with the caller that the rules are unclear as to
when a player becomes a justice on a board of appeals. With the statement
"Murphy is not a Justice in Appeal 1346a." judged TRUE in CFJ 1347, the
message announcing the appeal was clearly in error, as it listed Murphy as
a justice. Does this mean that no one has been assigned to be a justice,
or have only the two legally identified justices been assigned?

        In this case the rules don't clearly specify what is to be done in
the case of an invalid appeal announcement. The court has noted that the
rules specify for several other cases that the first valid announcement of
something is the only announement that has any effect. This seems to be a
sound approach, as it avoids ambiguity as long as one can identify the
first valid announcement.

        I tend to agree with the caller that the appointment of Justices
to a Board of Appeals takes place at the time of the first valid
announcement indicating the Players selected to serve. In this case, with
the announcement having been found invalid, I find that no Justices have
been appointed in Appeal 1346a.

        The court issues a judgement of TRUE for this CFJ.

Appellant Steve's Arguments:

There have been plenty of cases of mistaken Justice appointment in the
past that have not invalidated the other Justice appointments. Nor do I
think it is in the best interests of the game that this should occur.
