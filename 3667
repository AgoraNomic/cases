--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge G.'s Arguments:

The announcement of intent is buried in quotes, but not in quotes.
We generally allow that sort of thing (actions with quotes on either
side) so it's not really less clear than other intents that have been
found to be successful lately.  TRUE.


Judge G.'s Evidence:

Full message with announcement of intent:
(https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/2018-September/039218.html)

I pay 1 apple to move to (-1, 2).  I pay 1 apple to move to (0, 2).  I
take the coins at (0, 2).
[Comment: I am pretty confident that I can do this, even if the
initial transfer was
INEFFECTIVE, because I have Corona's implied consent]

If Corona has transferred these facilities to me, then I pay the
following upkeep
for the following facilities:

6    ( 0, +2)       Refinery    3 steel
7    (+2, +2)   2   Mine        2 lumber
A    (+2, -1)   2   Mine        2 lumber
G    (-3,  0)   2   Mine        2 lumber
8    (+2, +1)   2   Orchard     2 stones
B    (+2, -2)   2   Orchard     2 stones
F    (-2,  0)   2   Orchard     2 stones
J    (-4,  0)   3   Orchard     4 stones
K    (-5,  0)   3   Orchard     4 stones
C    (+1, -2)   2   Farm        1 lumber & 1 stone

If Corona has not transferred those facilities to me, then I still pay
the upkeep
specified above if and only if those payments of upkeep are EFFECTIVE
to prevent the facilities from being destroyed.

[Comment: For example, maybe I can pay the upkeep by Corona's implied consent--
but if my payments are not EFFECTIVE to prevent their destruction, then I don't
want to spend the money.  Am I doing this right..?]
