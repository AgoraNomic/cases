Caller's Arguments:

Arguments for TRUE:

Rule 2139 mandates the Registrar's monthly report to include “For each
former player for which the information is reasonably available, the
dates on which e registered and deregistered.” Now, a player is defined
as simply “a registered person”, which would indicate a “former player”
to refer to a person which at some point was registered. Other readings
include that it refers to the entity that was a player and ceased to
exist when that player was deregistered – this is not supported by
evidence. Indeed, the next paragraph of Rule 869 states that “[i]f e
does so [deregister], e CANNOT register or be registered for 30 days”,
which indicates the entity which is the player continues to exist after
deregistration. That is: playerhood is a state, and “former player”
should be understood as an entity which at some point in the past was
registered, but is no longer.

Now, back to the rule in question. It refers to “the dates on which e [a
former player] registered and deregistered”. The qualification “on which
e registered and deregistered” obviously refer to a pair of dates, and
not one date in which the player did both actions. That is not in
question and shall not be discussed further. But the point is that the
plural “dates” now refers to that pair of dates, and the definitive
article “the” makes the whole subject phrase have reference ONLY IF
there is a single entity that satisfies the condition.

Therefore, for people that became players more than once, the phrase has
no referent, and so is confusing and/or ambiguous. So is the whole as
well.

Note, if the rule said “the dates on which e registered OR
deregistered”, there would be a reasonable interpretation, more in tune
with the game's traditions, that the plural refers to all such dates in
which that particular player has either registered, deregistered, or
both. It is not so, however.

There remains only a single question: is there a more suitable
interpretation that makes it so the text is in accordance with (what I
suppose is) the intent of the rule? I'd say NOT, for if the plural in
“dates” accomodates a multitude of possible entities satisfying the
condition that follows, that condition would be “on which e registered
and deregistered” – which is much more rare than what has historically
appeared in Registrars' Monthly Reports.

Arguments for FALSE:

This is proposterous, nitpicking, and must not be indulged.

The caller's argument falls down at this point. "dates on which e
registered and deregistered" is not limited to being exactly two dates;
it could be a larger set of dates. Thus, adding "the" to it implies
only that there is one set of dates at which a player registered and
deregistered (and thus indicates that the entire set of dates is
required, not a subset). It doesn't "obviously refer to a pair of
dates"; in fact, it obviously refers to all of them. (To refer to a
pair, it would have to be worded along the lines of "the date at which
e registered and the date at which e deregistered".)

The use of "and" vesus "or" here is interesting, but reflects an ambiguity
of English. Consider the sentence "The balloons were red and blue". This
can be parsed in two ways: either it states that each balloon was both red
and blue, or else it states that some of the balloons were red and some of
them were blue. The same ambiguity exists in the text of the rule in
question, and the reading you're trying to impose on the rule obviously
(as you mention below) doesn't make sense, so (per rule 217) you need to
use the other reading.

I think this is sufficient to resolve the question you were asking in
the CFJ. However, the statement of the CFJ itself doesn't quite match
the question you apparently meant to ask; it is asking about persons
being deregistered, whereas if I remember correctly, in some points in
Agora's history, non-persons were deregistered (the rules at the time
were written along the lines of "if a player is ever not a person, e is
deregistered", and we've frequently had mechanics allowing legal
constructs / legal fictions to be persons; such persons typically
become non-persons when the rules defining them are repealed, and this
immediately deregisters them, but they are non-persons at the point of
deregistration). Additionally, there are several persons who have
registered but never deregistered; such persons have their date of
registration listed in the Registrar's weekly report, but not the
Registrar's monthly report. Therefore, the statement of the CFJ is
true, but on a technicality.

I judge CFJ 3999 TRUE (but note that, for the question the caller
probably intended to ask, the answer would be FALSE).
