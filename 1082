     General Chaos, Harlequin, Jester, Kolja A., Michael, Morendil,
     Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve, Swann, & Time Agent were

History:

  Called by Kolja A., 22 Jan 1998 22:15:31 +1100
  Assigned to General Chaos, 23 Jan 1998 16:11:55 +0000
  Judged TRUE, 29 Jan 1998 08:42:25 -0500

Caller's Arguments:

I quote Rule 1431/10 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim
      commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime,
      unless e then admits the Claim within 72 hours after the
      incorrect denial.

None of us were "the Player who is required by the Rules to publish the
information subject to a Claim", as I find no Rule that _requires_ anyone to
publish the information subject to this Claim, therefore the Rule states no
allotted time for a Response from any of us. We have therefore not yet
failed to
respond within the (unspecified) allotted time.   :oP

======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

CFJ 1082 asks the question whether Chuck's report of multiple
Infractions of Delayed COE Response regarding his COE on the report of
Harlequin's Win (reported by Harlequin) was in error.  This Court
finds that the all such reports were erroneous.  There are several
related issues, which will be taken up below.

First, whether an error existed:  This Court finds that there was in
fact an error, adopting without discussion the ruling of our sister
Court in CFJ 1081.

Second, whether an admission of the error pursuant to the COE was
required as a consequence of the error: This Court finds that no
Player was obliged to respond to Chuck's COE because no Player is
obliged by the Rules to post announcement of Player Wins by the
Insanity Rule, and thus there was no "Player who is required by the
Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim" (Rule 1431/10).

Third, whether Rule 1431's fourth paragraph establishes an Infraction
for any Player who fails to respond to a Claim, irregardless of
whether e is required to do so by Rule 1431's third paragraph: This
Court finds that, while the position apparently adopted by Chuck in
attempting to impose the Infractions is not directly excluded by the
language of Rule 1431, it seems reasonably clear that the referent of
"A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time" should
be and is restricted to those Players who are actually obliged to do
so, under Rule 1431's third paragraph.  Therefore, it is this Court's
opinion that Rule 1431's fourth paragraph establishes no liability for
Players other than those named by Rule 1431's third paragraph.

Thus, while the Claim of Error was correct, and there was an error,
the Rules do not require any Player to admit the error, and do not
allow the imposition of an Infraction upon any Player for failing to
do so.  The alleged Infractions did not occur, and Chuck's report of
them was erroneous.  This Court is not asked to consider the question
of whether Chuck's report of these alleged Infractions, and the
Payment Orders e alleged to execute at the same time time, were in
fact valid, and thus will not take up that question.

Judgement of TRUE is entered.  It is so ordered.
