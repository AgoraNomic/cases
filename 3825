Caller's Arguments:

Rule 649 ("Patent Titles") states that a person SHALL award a patent title 
within a timely fashion after the conditions authorising em to do so are 
announced.

Rule 2415 ("Badges") states that a badge is a kind of patent title, and
that any player CAN award a badge.

This would appear to suggest that becoming a player authorises em, and
hence obligates em to award a badge upon registering.

Many rules throughout the ruleset use "authorise" to simply mean "permit", 
supporting this connection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

FALSE. The clause in question in Rule 2415 requires Agoran consent, so
the conditions authorizing such an award do not arise until/unless
intent is announced and then Agoran consent is obtained.
