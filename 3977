Caller's Arguments:

Is "RWO" reasonably clear shorthand for "(ratification / ratify) without
objection"? Is there any other reason why eir attempt to intend this would
have been ineffective?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge 4st's Arguments:

SecretSnail9 did not intend to ratify without objection, and even if e
did, it was irrelevant. SecretSnail9 did not follow rules as written,
game custom, or the best interests of the game, but did not violate
anything deliberately, nor for personal gain. The abbreviation of "RWO"
was not codified at this time, and is the primary reason for this
decision. Note also that I believe that calling this CFJ was irrelevant;
it reiterates the need to play Agoranomic in a clear and unambiguous way,
but it otherwise is irrelevant, as I think many other judgements have
already determined this need.

In detail with regard to the standards for judgement, I have the
following reasons:

1. based on the rules as written
There is unclear intent:
It is not clear enough that "RWO" is shorthand for Ratification Without
Objection. I am a new player, however, given that at least one other
player also agrees that this shorthand is not sufficiently descriptive,
then how am I to know that such an intent is something I can "object" to?
In addition, RWO could mean "ReWrite Officially", or "Redo With Outline",
or "Recusing With Objection" which are all particularly apt with the given
context.

Excerpt from Rule 1728:
"
A person CAN act on eir own behalf, by announcement, to table an
intent (syn. "intend") to perform a tabled action, conspicuously
and without obfuscation specifying the action, the method
(including non- default parameter values), and optionally,
conditions.
"

Additionally, there is concern about what the pronouns refer to.
Does it refer to the statement as a whole? Does it refer to the CFJ?
Does it refer to the motion to extend?
For ratification without objection, "it" would have to refer
to the statement as a whole. However, previously in the sentence,
"this" seems to refer to an action, ie, the motion to extend,
as it was claimed to "fail". These two usages would be fine,
if "ratification without objection" were clearly stated,
as it would be easy to parse from context. However,
because it is unknown, "ratification without objection"
seems like a less likely abbreviation.

Therefore, I determine that use of an unknown acronym
("RWO") is sufficient obfuscation, and the intent failed.

2. game custom
I believe it is game custom to be as clear as possible, while also
leaving things to be done as simply as possible.
In addition to the rules as written, we see more attempts to
define that things should be done clearly in other rules.

Excerpt from Rule 478, as an example:
"
Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
and unambiguously.
"

Therefore, the intent failed.

3. common sense
i. The "ratification without objection" has objections:

Regardless of whether or not the intent was clear enough to exist,
the fact that it has objections renders this judgement somewhat irrelevant.
It couldn't ratify without objection even if it was clearly stated.
However, other people were able to object, understanding that,
in fact, it stood for "ratification without objection".

Therefore, the intent succeeded, but is also irrelevant.

ii.
I did not check that timestamps precisely,
but I believe that e had already filed a motion to extend
and that such a thing also need not be ratified, based on their
initial message.

Excerpt from Rule 591: "
If the judge of an open CFJ has not violated a time limit for
assigning it a judgement, and has not previously filed a motion to
either extend or reconsider the case, e CAN file a motion to
extend the case by announcement. Doing so extends eir judgement
deadline for that case by one week. In doing so, e SHOULD include
a (nonbinding) draft or outline of eir current thoughts on the
case.
"
E did file a motion to extend the case, and did so by announcement.
E did NOT include a draft or outline at that particular time e first filed
a motion,
however, e did include a draft or outline shortly thereafter.
Overall, a "SHOULD" was temporarily violated, which
is defined by Rule 2152, excerpt follows:
"
8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
described action, the full implications of failing to perform
it ought to be understood and carefully weighed.
"

Thus, the CFJ period for judgement was successfully extended,
and therefore, there is no need to ratify it. (assuming I understood
the timestamps correctly).
Thus, the intent was irrelevant.

4. past judgements
I do not really have information on past judgements, however, I think
that this judgement is relatively straightforward, and would follow
similar judgements about the ambiguity of statements, which result in
the intended action or intent failing.

Thus, the intent failed.

5. consideration of the best interests of the game.
i. clear gameplay
I believe that it is in the best interests of the game to continue
encouraging clear, unobfuscated actions, so that any further new players,
any returning players, and general gameplay can be continued without
arguments on the semantics of a particular situation.

Therefore, the intent failed.

ii. future state
I believe that this judgement, in the future, will also continue to
encourage clear gameplay for all involved parties. Particularly,
there has been some interest in using other languages, and allowing
undefined acronyms to exist as valid gameplay would impact this severely,
as RWO could be an acronym for something completely different
in another language, not to mention, it could mean many things in English
as already noted.

Therefore, the intent failed.

iii. irrelevant CFJs
I believe that this judgement should be IRRELEVANT. We keep creating CFJs
that seem to have little effect on the gameplay, obfuscating
the history of the important CFJs. However, in the interest of actually
resolving this issue and any further issues that may stem from it,
for some reason, I think in the best interest of the game, I am providing
a definitive judgement for clarity's sake.

Therefore, the intent was irrelevant.
