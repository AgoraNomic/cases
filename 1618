Caller's Arguments:

As CFJ 1589 was recently reversed confirming my inactivity as of september
18th 2006.  At that point, and since then inactivity hasn't been in the
ruleset, and thus although I have the property it seems to have no effect on
gameplay.  CFJ 1589 clearly makes the distinction that i was inactive, stating
that i would become active upon returning to agora.  I believe that CFJ 1598
does not have the power to make me active again, thus meaning i have retained
my inactivity and have not preformed many of the actions it seems like i have
preformed as of late.

I believe that CFJ1589 does not have the power to make me active again once i
started participating in Agora again.

Judge Zefram's Arguments:

As the ruleset does not supply a definition of "active" or "inactive",
and neither law nor mathematics provides an applicable definition,
I find that the ordinary English meaning of the words applies.

Most uses of "active" in the ruleset refer to "active player", which
under usual English grammar must be interpreted as meaning a player who
is actively playing.  Merely being a player does not constitute active
play; one must engage in actions that are of significance to the rules,
such as voting, publishing official reports, or participating in the
judicial process.  Passive behaviour that is significant to the rules,
such as doing nothing to allow a time limit to expire, is not active play.
I find that a player need not be presently peforming any of these actions
in order to be an "active player"; any recent activity, or especially
a pattern of activity, qualifies one as an "active player".

Rule 1826 and the statement of CFJ 1618 refer to a person being "active"
without using the phrase "active player".  This could be interpreted as
referring to a wider standard of activity.  An active player (as defined
above) is definitely "active" in the context of the game.  A non-player
who engages in game-relevant actions, such as calling CFJs, is also
"active".  I leave open the question of whether game-unrelated activity
can also qualify one as "active", because it does not affect these CFJs.

For CFJ 1618, Quazie's level of activity is to be judged at the time the
CFJ was called (R217).  At that instant Quazie was calling for judgement,
which is definitely game-relevant activity.  E was therefore definitely
active in the context of the game, and so I judge CFJ 1618 FALSE.  It is
not necessary for this CFJ to consider how far in the past relevant
activity can be in order for a person to qualify as "active".
