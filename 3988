      Delivering a CFJ judgement that is not "appropriate" as defined in
      R591 is a rules violation.

Caller's Arguments:

First, I think it's a very slippery slope to suggest punishing judges for
judgements, at least for the vast majority of disagreements - I'm not at
all sure if judgements, even bad faith ones, should be penalized at all.
But I want to determine if submitting "bad" judgements (for certain values
of "bad") is actually a violation of any rule, just so we know.

For the first CFJ, R217 reads in part:
>     When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
>     takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
>     unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
>     judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
Note that this is imperative.  It could/should be read "the text of the
rules SHALL take precedence" and "it SHALL be augmented by game custom,
common sense, past judgements, and consideration of the bests interests of
the game" without changing meaning (the imperative reads very much as a
SHALL, not a SHOULD).  CFJs are clearly the rules-recognized means for
"interpreting and applying" rules.  So failure to "interpret and apply"
rules via a CFJ in accordance with this paragraph would violate this rule.

For the second CFJ, R591 defines circumstances under which different
judgements are "appropriate".  By inference, any judgements that don't fit
the criteria are "inappropriate".  By dictionary definition,
"inappropriate" means "not suitable or proper in the circumstances" and
the example sentence given by google is actually "there are penalties for
inappropriate behavior" which implies that it means a rules violation.
(Though unlike the first, imperative-tense CFJ, "inappropriate" is weaker
than e.g. "invalid" so this maybe governed by the equivalent to a SHOULD,
not a SHALL).

For both CFJs, there's the possibility that a bad faith judgement also
violates R101's "Please treat Agora Right Good Forever" but I think that's
much more of a stretch.

Judge ais523's Arguments:

As for CFJ 3988, "appropriate" is defined in R591, but nothing seems to
reference the definition (all uses of "appropriate", besides the
definition, are applied to something other than judgements and thus use
the standard English meaning of the word). This is most likely a bug
caused by gradual amendment of the rule over time; assigning
inappropriate judgements was explicitly illegal under some past
ruleset. I checked an arbitrary old SLR I had handy, and here's an
excerpt from rule 2158/5 (which has since been repealed):
{{{
      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its case
      has a judge assigned to it, the judge CAN assign a valid
      judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so as soon as
      possible.  A judge SHALL NOT assign an inappropriate judgement
      to any judicial question.  A judgement is valid and/or
      appropriate only as defined by the rules.  Defining these things
      is secured, with a power threshold of 1.7.  If more than one
      judgement is valid and appropriate, then the choice between them
      is left to the judge's discretion.
}}}
[note for newer players: "as soon as possible" = "within 7 days" under
the rules at the time; nowadays we use "in a timely fashion" instead]

[Side note: a power threshold of 1.7? Really?]

Even though the requirement to assign appropriate judgements has been
repealed, "appropriate" is still defined in the current ruleset (and
has mostly been around continuously). IIRC the requirement to assign
appropriate judgements was intentionally removed in a huge paring-back
of the judicial system, that gave us this (R591/41):
{{{
      The valid judgements, based on the facts of the case at the time
      the CFJ was initiated, are TRUE, FALSE, and DISMISS.  DISMISS is
      appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
      irrelevant to the game, if insufficient information exists to
      make a judgement with reasonable effort, or the statement is
      otherwise not able to be answered TRUE or FALSE.
}}}
At the time, if I remember correctly, it was noted that there were no
usage guidelines for the TRUE and FALSE judgements, although people
generally used them with their obvious meanings anyway. Still, the
"appropriate" phrasing was still in use in tne rules even then.

Anyway, there's a legal requirement for judges to assign a valid
judgement to CFJs, but no longer a legal requirement to assign an
appropriate judgement â€“ nowadays, inappropriate judging tends to be
handled via appeals rather than via blotting. This is probably for the
best, especially given the recent experiment with making blotting for
rules violations platonic rather than pragmatic.

As an interesting parallel, R1367 defines "appropriate" for degrees,
and likewise doesn't seem to make use of the definition (there are some
SHOULDs in close proximity, but that don't seem to link to the
definition). The intention seems to be that of encouraging people to
support/object to a tabled action in specific circumstances, but
without any actual legally binding requirement. The same intention
seems to be having an effect on the CFJ system in practice, but this
affects the rules only via game custom, and I'm not aware of any rules
that care about CFJ judgement assignment and are ambiguous enough to
require an R217 tiebreak.
