==============================  CFJ 1920  ==============================

    If the offer in the evidence section (1) were published by me, then
    accepted, any person would be able to become a party to the
    resultant contract by announcement.

Caller's Evidence:

Evidence (1):

I intend to agree with Goethe that if e wears a hat, I will also wear a hat.

Evidence (2):

Rule 2198/0 (Power=1.5)
Making Contract Changes
...
      If a contract does not purport to regulate becoming a party to
      it, than any person CAN become a party to it by announcement.

Evidence (3):
> >  There is a lot that you can read into a contract.  If I made a public
> >  post "I intend to agree with comex to do X", the implicit inclusion
> >  of your name is the exception (comex can join) that proves the rule
> >  (no one else can join).  But also, there is implicit the notion of
> >  binding, etc.

Judge G.'s Arguments:

The offer in question:  "I intend to agree with Goethe that if e wears a hat,
I will also wear a hat." uses straightforward and common-sense language which
any reasonable person would take as limiting (regulating) the offer to being
between "I" and Goethe.  This limitation satisfies the "purport to regulate"
clause of R2198.  FALSE.
