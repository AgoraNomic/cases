Judge o's Arguments (initial):

I find this CFJ to be FALSE, following the caller’s arguments exactly. The
alleged claim of error was

> CoE this is bugging me.

Sent in response to an attempt to collect a report award, and without any 
trivially obvious error in either the reward attempt or the report, this is 
insufficient for a claim of error.


Arguments for calling a moot by V.J. Rada:

I would like to direct you to CFJ 3551 in which  you indirectly held
that "I COE this for no reason" was a valid CoE.


Judge o's Arguments (post-moot):

I find this CFJ to be FALSE, following the caller’s arguments exactly. The 
alleged claim of error was

> CoE this is bugging me.

Sent in response to an attempt to collect a report award, and without any 
trivially obvious error in either the reward attempt or the report, this is 
insufficient for a claim of error.

CFJ 3551 found that a claim of error such as "I CoE my Reportor's report for 
no reason” could allow a revision of that report to be published such that it 
fulfils a duty. This is an incidental finding at best - it is neither relevant 
to the matter at issue in that CFJ, nor consistent with the text of rule 2201. 
It should therefore not be taken as binding precedent on what constitutes a 
valid claim of error.
