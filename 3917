Judge G.'s Arguments:

CFJ 3798 found that for information to be published in the performance of
a weekly duty, it must be "informative".  Part of that standard was:

> * Each part must be reasonably-well labelled (so we are informed as to
> what it is) [2];
> [2] Information is not information if we don’t know what information
> it’s supposed to be, so some kind of label is needed.

A buried abbreviation UF that does not appear in the rules and is buried
in a history section without explanation, in what looks like a generic
self-check script output, does not fulfill this requirement.

On timeliness, CFJ 3798 allowed for some backdating, but stated that it
would fail to qualify as being "maintained" if it was backdated much
outside the frequency of the report.  So in the May 31 report, the May 1
record is too old to be considered "maintained" for a weekly duty.

The real question is, does missing a single record of this nature
disqualify the whole report?  For example, if an officer failed to list a
new player on a list of players, it would be subject to CoE but still
would have fulfilled a reporting duty.  CFJ 3462 set a high standard
("gross sloppiness and negligence") for disqualifying a reasonable report
attempt from being a duty-fulfilling report.

So what about in this case?  The caller noted:
> In my defense, the bit requiring that I track the UF is
> in a weird place.
By this, I believe that e means that most of the "floating economy"
variables are defined in R2634, while the Unit of Floatation is in
standalone rule 2635.

However, this actually works against the caller.  If UF were listed
alongside the other Buoyancy numbers, we might say "e missed one out of
three quantities, and the one e missed can be calculated from the others -
it's mostly there" and allow it.  However, since it's in a standalone
rule, it's singled out for special attention.  It's not the officer's
place to necessarily decide the importance - the fact that there's a
standalone requirement, in a separate rule (and, I note in the SLR,
immediately following the first rule, so not particularly hidden) means
that a whole "section" of the report is missing, even if that's only a
single (labelled) number.

While the rules can be tricky and missing little things can be common,
officers should generally be knowledgeable on the plain-text duties of
their office - so in this case, missing that whole section *is* in fact
negligence.  A minor, accidental, and inconsequential kind of negligence,
to be sure, especially given the difficulty of the Treasuror's job and H.
Treasuror Trigon's high level and quality of past service, but still
negligent enough to disqualify the report.

I find FALSE.
