Caller's Arguments:

Wielding the Power Stone "Buys Strength", which was previously defined by
Rule 2653 (Buying Strength), but that rule (which limited its effect to
ordinary proposals whose decision was in progress at that time) was repealed
a few months ago. In the absence of that rule, should "Buys Strength" be
interpreted as working the same way, or working some other way more closely
resembling its ordinary language interpretation, or failing to actually
increase anything due to insufficient specification?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge snail's Arguments:

I judge CFJ 3996 FALSE. I judge CFJ 3997 FALSE.

"Buys Strength" seems to be an instantaneous trigger that happens to not
have any effects relying on that trigger, after the repeal of said effects.
It seems like common sense for the repeal of the only rule that increased
voting strength to result in a ruleset where you can't increase your voting
strength, but we shouldn't have left the artifact in the rules.

Rule 2422 (Voting Strength) says "If not otherwise specified, the voting
strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is 3." Saying a player buys
strength under the current ruleset doesn't really "specify" a modification
or setting of voting strength, thus voting strength was not increased by
using the power stone.
