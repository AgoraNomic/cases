The bids marked with a (*) were submitted by Wes at the time given, but
e claims that they were also previously submitted sometime on Saturday
Mar 11. E has produced no evidence to back this claim, but it is possible,
since the Gecko mail sever, home to the Agora mailing lists, crashed on
the weekend in question, and some mail was lost. (See item (f) in the 
Evidence).

Palnatoke claims that e submitted the bids mark (**) at the date given.
To prove this, e posted a message from eir "Sent Items folder" with the
given Date stamp.

It is also important to note that R1887 states that:

 "A Bid is a message, sent to the Public Forum, announcing that the sender 
  is bidding in that particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid." 

and that:

 "[An] Auction ends when 72 hours have passed without a valid Bid higher
  than the Nth-highest Bid (at the time the Bid is made) having been made." 

Thus Bids are made by _sending_ messages to the Public Forum, and the 
Auction ends 72 hours after a winning Bid is made (ie sent).

Now let us consider each Auction individually:

High Oligarch
-------------
harvel made a winning Bid in the Auction for High Oligarch on Mar 9 at 
17:26:46 (GMT). Palnatoke allegedly made a bid on Mar 12 at 21:26:30 (GMT)
but this was not a winning bid and so had no effect on the ending time.
By 17:26:46 on Mar 12, no further winning bids had been made, so the 
Auction ended. The fact that harvel retracted this bid at 13:00:09 (GMT)
on Mar 11 has no bearing on this. Neither does Blob's invalid bid on Mar 13.

Therefore, this Auction ended at 17:26:46 (GMT) on Mar 12

Middle Oligarchs
----------------
This situation is more complex. 

* harvel made a winning Bid at 17:26:46 on Mar 9.
* Wes alleges that e made a winning bid sometime on Mar 11.
* Blob attempted to make a further winning bid at 01:11:26 on Mar 13.

If Wes' claim is correct, then the Auction is still in progress, as there
was less than 72 hours between harvel's bid and Wes' bid, and less than
72 hours between Wes' bid and Blob's bid. 

If Wes' claim is incorrect, then the Auction ended at 17:26:46 (GMT) on 
Mar 12, 72 hours after harvel's bid. 

Low Oligarchs
-------------
* harvel made a winning Bid at 17:26:46 on Mar 9. 
* Wes alleges that e made a winning bid sometime on Mar 11.
* Wes attempted to make a winning bid at 13:38:25 on Mar 15

If Wes' claim is incorrect, then the Auction ended at 17:26:46 (GMT) on 
Mar 12, 72 hours after harvel's bid. 

If Wes' claim is correct, then the Auction ended sometime on Mar 14,
72 hours after Wes' bid on Mar 11. 

Wes' subsequent bid on Mar 15 was invalid either way.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

(a) Rule 1887
(b) The annoucement of the Auction by Murphy on March 6
(c) harvel's bids of March 9
(d) Blob's bids of March 13
(e) Wes' bids of March 15
(f) A statement from Geoff Wong, relayed by Steve, noting that some 
    mail was lost from the gecko server on the weekend of 11-12 March.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
(a)

Rule 1887/4 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Auctions

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      (a) Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is responsible for collecting
          bids and announcing the result of the Auction.  Unless
          otherwise specified, the Speaker shall be the Auctioneer.

      (b) Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction.
          On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir
          Bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one
          particular currency. If the Rules do not specify a Currency
          to be used, then the Auction does not proceed.

      (d) Number of Items: Each Auction is conducted for 1 or more
          identical items.  Throughout this Rule, N indicates the
          number of items up for bid in the Auction.

      (e) Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the first
          correct and legal announcement that an Auction is begun, as
          defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public Forum,
          together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the Auction
          Currency, the number of items, and the value of the Starting
          Bid.

      (f) Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
          value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Starting Bid
          is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (g) Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
          during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
          Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that
          particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is only
          valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

        (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the Auction,
            or after its end.
        (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the
            Auction Currency.
        (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.

      (h) Cancelling Bids: A Bid may be cancelled by its Bidder by
          posting such to the Public Forum, clearly identifying the
          Bid to be cancelled, while the Auction is in progress.

      (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
          there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 72 hours have passed
          without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid (at the
          time the Bid is made) having been made.  The Auction shall
          end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has not
          ended earlier.

      (j) Winning Bids: When the Auction ends, the winning Bids are
          the N largest uncancelled valid Bids in that auction (or all
          valid uncancelled Bids, if there were less than N valid
          uncancelled Bids.  Ties shall be broken in favor of
          earlier-submitted bids.  The Auctioneer shall announce the
          winning Bids and their Bidders as soon as possible after the
          end of the Auction.  For each winning Bid, the Auctioneer
          shall bill the associated Bidder:

        (1) The amount of the Nth highest Bid, if there were N or
            more valid uncancelled Bids in the auction;
        (2) The Starting Bid, if there were fewer than N valid
            uncancelled Bids.

          Note that it is possible for a single Player to have more
          than one Winning Bid.  If this happens, the Auctioneer shall
          issue separate POs for each Winning Bid and shall not
          combine them into a single PO, and this Rule takes
          precedence over Rules which would permit such a combination.

I initiate an Auction for the position of High Oligarch.
I initiate an Auction for the two positions of Middle Oligarch.
I initiate an Auction for the three positions of Low Oligarch.
    
For each of these Auctions, the Auctioneer is me, the Currency
is VTs, and the Starting Bid is 1 VT.

For reference, here is a list of attempted bids up to this point,
in case anyone wants to bid the same thing as they did before:

Yes - I'm afraid it true. Gecko crashed badly over the weekend
(maybe due to script kiddies - not sure why). Anyway - I had
to restore gecko from tape so some mail was lost.

========================================================================

Judge Steve's Arguments:

Evidently, this CFJ owes its existence to a typo Blob made in composing CFJs
1200-1203.

My first instinct was to dismiss the CFJ under R1565(i) as containing no
clearly identifiable Statement, since what we have here is a fragment of
other Statements. But it occurred to me that we could still read "23:40:31
-0800" as a time marker, in which case there is a Statement here, namely
that a certain time has ended. Of course this is an odd, perhaps nearly
ungrammatical, thing to assert, but it's not utterly senseless: perhaps we
could read it as analogous to the claim that "six o'clock has passed". Such
a Statement might be true or false depending on what time it is when (and
where) the question is asked, which suggests that R1565(ii) might not be the
right road to dismissal, either.

I therefore dismiss CFJ 1202, in accordance with R1565(iii), that its
Statement does not pertain to a matter relevant to the Rules. 

========================================================================

Judge Steve's Evidence:

<none>

I think the issue is that Wes purports to be plural.
