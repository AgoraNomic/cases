Caller's Arguments:

While everyone else's hands are currently frozen, the freezing
occured because of an event [R2075] flipping a stuck switch
[R2074].  Because Quazie's hand wasn't explicitly Frozen, it is
in the default state [R2040], which is the first listed state
in R2074, that is, Free.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 2074/0 (Power=2)
Hand Flux

       Flux is a stuck switch for Gamblers with states Free and Frozen.
       Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, a Gambler with frozen
       flux may not play, discard, or transfer cards from eir hand, nor
       may the Deckmastor satisfy pending draws for that hand.

       The Deck's flux shall always be free, rules to the contrary
       nonwithstanding.

Rule 2075/1 (Power=1)
Winning Hands

       The Deckmastor's Budget shall contain between one and three
       Winning Hands, each of which is a list of cards with a hand size
       at least two greater than the Maximum Hand Size.

       If a Gambler's Hand is identical to a winning hand at any
       particular moment, any Gambler has 72 hours from that moment to
       announce that a Gambler holds or has held a winning hand.

       If the announcement is false, the Deckmastor shall, as soon as
       possible, transfer 1 card at random from the announcing
       Gambler's Hand to the Deck.

       If the announcement is true, the holding Gambler Wins the Game,
       and is awarded the boon of Pokerface and the defined regular
       Patent Title Champion.

       Exactly one week after a true announcement, the Flux of all
       Gamblers except the Deck shall become frozen.  The Deckmastor
       shall transfer random cards from the hands of each frozen
       gambler to the deck, until each frozen gambler has either (a) a
       hand size equal to or less than the Minimum hand size or (b) no
       cards.  Then, the Deckmaster shall deal cards to the winner up
       to the maximum hand size.  When these tasks have been peformed,
       the Flux of every Gambler shall become free.

       If no one has won the game in the last six months, then any
       Gambler may announce a Skunk, which shall trigger the effects of
       a true announcement of a win above, except that no boon shall be
       awarded nor shall extra winner's cards be dealt.

Rule 2040/1 (Power=2)
Switches

       A switch is a set of states associated with a class of entities.
       Each switch shall have a default state, which if not otherwise
       specified shall be the first state mentioned in the rule
       defining the switch.

       The recordkeepor for a class of entities shall also maintain
       records of any switches associated with that class, as well as
       the current state of the switch for each entity of the class.
       If the recordkeepor is required to publish a report, that report
       shall include records of these switches.  The rules may require
       a different player to maintain and report these records.

       Whenever an entity is created in a class of entities associated
       with a switch, it shall be in the state of the switch specified
       by the order or provision creating it; if no state is specified,
       it shall be in the default state of the switch.

       Whenever an entity joins a class of entities associated with a
       switch, the entity shall be in the default state of the switch.

       A player who may flip a switch on an entity to some state may do
       so by announcement.  In eir announcement, e must indicate the
       entity, switch, and new state.  When a switch on an entity is
       flipped to some state, the entity shall come to be in that state
       and simultaneously cease to be in any other state of the switch.

       A switch is loose unless the rules define it as stuck.

       An executor of an entity may flip any of the loose switches on
       that entity, unless the rules otherwise prohibit doing so.

       The stuck switches on an entity can be flipped only when the
       rules so indicate.

       Whenever a switch is created, or becomes associated with a class
       of entities, then each entity in the class that had previously
       been in a state that is now a state of the switch shall continue
       to be in that state; all other entities in the class shall be in
       the default state of the switch.

Judge Manu's Arguments:

I must agree with Goethe's argument that "[...]Because Quazie's hand
wasn't explicitly Frozen, it is in the default state [R2040], which is
the first listed state in R2074, that is, Free."

According to R2075: "When these tasks have been peformed, the Flux of
every Gambler shall become free." - while it explicitely declares that
the Flux will be switched from Frozen to Free after the Deckmastor's
maintenance tasks, nothing in the Rules defines the arrival of new
Gamblers while all active decks are Frozen.

Rule 2040 (Switches) has a Power of 2 and R2075 has a Power of 1.
Thus, I view that Flux's default state (Free) is still valid.
On that, I return a judgement of TRUE for CFJ 1530.
