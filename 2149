Judge G.'s Arguments:

According to the top-ranked search results, *this* is to celebrate:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwEMxYggoKQ

The dictionary definition, on the other hand, is specifically (MW-online):
"1: to perform (a sacrament or solemn ceremony) publicly and with
appropriate rites..."  Emphasis here is on "publicly".  Since Agora has
defined "publicly" as the same thing as "announcing" (R478 second to last
paragraph), and "appropriate rites" and "solemn ceremony" in this case are
not rules-mandated and so up to the performer, I find that saying publicly
that you celebrate something is the Agoran equivalent to performing such a
ceremony of celebration.

Finally, according to the current "simultaneous but sequential" precedents,
I note that "a moment ago" may refer, provided it does not create ambiguity,
to something in the same message but previously in sequence.  TRUE.
