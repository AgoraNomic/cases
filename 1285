==============================  CFJ 1285  ==============================

    Between the time of the creation of the "Enrich the Contestmaster"
    Contest and this CFJ, Syllepsis, Ziggy, and Steve each successfully
    lowered the number of Stems they possess by 50, thus paying the
    Entry Fee for the Contest and successfully increasing the number of
    Stems possessed by the "Enrich the Contestmaster" Contest (in the
    Contest Fund) by 150 (total).

Judged FALSE by Kelly:                  22 Mar 2001 16:54:59 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1539 states
     "The Regulations [of a Contest] can specify... The amount of
     the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of units of any
     specific Currency."

and further that
     "A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
     paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund."

Clearly, Stems are one of the set delimited by "any specific Currency"
as Stems are a specific Currency, and "any" means, well, "any".
Therefore, looking at #1539 in isolation, the Entry Fee (distinct from
a "Fee" defined in #1941, as it is not payed to the Bank)  may be in
Stems, and is payed to the Contest Fund.

The only reasonable interpretation for the effect of "paying an Entry
Fee" to an entity is that the holdings of the payer (in units of the
paid Currency)  are decreased by the indicated amount, and the
holdings of the payee (in units of the paid Currency) are increased
by the indicated amount. Anything else would require a radical
redefinition of the idea of "paying". Regulation 102 of the "Enrich
the Contestmaster" Contest is within the Rules when it decares this
Entry Fee.

But is such a payment allowed?  Rule 1910 states that:
      "Transfers of Stems are permitted only if either the transferor
      or the transferee is the Bank. All other transfers of Stems are
      prohibited."

Looking at #1539 and #1910 together, either
 (a) "paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund" in 1539
     is not a "Transfer" of Stems as per 1910, but a distinct type
     of (permitted by the Rules) payment to the Contest Fund, or
 (b) Rule 1539 ("Regulation and Membership of Contests") conflicts
     with Rule 1910 ("Stems").  In this case, as both 1539 and 1910
     have Power=1, 1539 has precedence over 1910 (by Rule 1030).

So in EITHER case (a) or (b), Stems may be payed to a Contest Fund by
a Contestant, if the Regulations of the Contest set Stems as an
Entry Fee.

In the Contest "Enrich the Contestmaster", the prescribed Entry Fee set
forth by the Regulations is clearly 50 Stems.  Messages to the PF, in
conjunctions with the Regulations of this Contest (see Caller's Evidence)
clearly indicate that Syllepsis, Steve, and Ziggy, in the words of 1539,
"payed the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund."  Thus, each of
their Stems holdings should be decreased by 50, and the Stem holdings
of the "Enrich the Contestmaster" Contest Fund should be increased by
150 (total).  I present no arguments to judge whether or not this should
be considered a "Transfer" as per 1910.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 1539/1 (Power=1)
Regulations and Membership of Contests

      No Player within Jurisdiction of a Contest's Regulations is
      bound to obey any Regulation or combination of Regulations that
      conflict with the Rules.

      The Regulations can specify the following:

        i) How a Contestmaster is replaced. No person may become
           Contestmaster without eir consent.  If left unspecified,
           the Contestmaster cannot change while the Contest exists.
       ii) How the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent.  If
           this is not specified, they may only be spent when the
           Rules require it.
      iii) The amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of any specific Currency.
       iv) Additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may resign at any time by
      posting a message to that effect to the Public Forum, at which
      time e ceases to be Contestmaster.


Rule 1910/3 (Power=1)
Stems

      Stems are a Bank Currency. The MUQ of Stems is 1. The
      Recordkeepor for Stems is the Payroll Clerk.

      Transfers of Stems are permitted only if either the transferor
      or the transferee is the Bank. All other transfers of Stems are
      prohibited.

      However, in the case that an Organization somehow obtains Stems,
      it shall nevertheless be allowed to transfer those to Players,
      as long as this is done within seven days of when the Stems are
      obtained.

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

The following text is an Application to Create an Organization
as per Rule 1533:

i)    The class of the Organization is Contest.

ii)   The Name of the Organization is "Enrich the Contestmaster".

            followed by the acceptance, in the PF, of the announced
            Potential Contestmaster.  The Potential Contestmaster
            becomes the Contestmaster from the instant of eir
            acceptance, provided eir acceptance occurs within
            72 hours of the announcement.
      102.  The amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest is 50 Stems.
      103.  A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster
            and paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A

========================================================================

Judge Kelly's Arguments:

I find Taral's argument, that there is no conflict, to be quite
compelling.  In my opinion, Rule 1539 does not authorize the payment
of entry fees; it merely states a necessary condition to become a
member of a Contest.  If other Rules make it impossible for that
condition to befall, then the consequence is that no Player can join
the Contest; such a conclusion is consistent with every Rule.  Players
may abide by every Rule by refraining from joining the Contest; thus,
no conflict exists.

Nor does it seem reasonable to me to conclude that the term "pay" in
Rule 1539 should be read as a "pseudotransfer" having all the effects
of a Transfer but not actually being a Transfer.  The Rules
consistently (as pointed out by Oerjan) use the term "pay" to refer to
a transfer of Currency (or, in some cases, Property) from one entity
to another.  Rule 1598 explicitly states that a Notice of Transfer is
the only means by which property can be transferred.  I see nothing in
Rule 1539 that creates a mechanism for payment exclusive of that
described in Rule 1598 or which overrides the prohibition on Stem
transfers other than to or from the Bank contained in Rule 1910.

I conclude that none of Ziggy, Steve, and Syllepsis has successfully
executed a Notice of Transfer for the amount of 50 Stems (on the
grounds that each such Notice of Transfer failed to "describe a
transfer which is not otherwise prohibited by the Rules" (Rule 1598),
specifically, Rule 1910.  Since I conclude that no such transfers have
taken place, I further conclude none of these Players has had eir
balances reduced by the amounts alleged, nor has the balance of the
Contest's Treasury been augmented as alleged.

Judgement of FALSE is entered.
