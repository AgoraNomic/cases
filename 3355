=========================  Criminal Case 3355  =========================

    ais523 violated Rule 2170 by selecting a confusing nickname by
    selecting the nickname "woggle" on an Agoran forum in the quoted
    message.

========================================================================

Caller:                                 woggle
Barred:                                 ais523

Judge:                                  Murphy
Judgement:                              NOT GUILTY

========================================================================

History:

Called by woggle:                       28 Jun 2013 14:45:12 GMT
Assigned to Murphy:                     03 Jul 2013 19:27:00 GMT
Judged NOT GUILTY by Murphy:            06 Jul 2013 13:24:50 GMT

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

CFJ 3179 found it was legal to use confusing nicknames on non-Agoran fora, but
here, ais523 has chosen a confusing nickname on an Agoran forum (albeit a
discussion forum) for the purpose of what is effectively Agoran game play
(albeit through the Foreign Relations rule).

Gratuitous Arguments by OscarMeyr:

A-D is Not A Public Forum, and is not subject to the strictness of a PF.  As
long as someone makes it clear *each time* that their potentially confusing
nickname is not going to confuse Agora play, it's okay.  So in my book, as
long as ais523 clearly identifies eir use of "woggle" as eir nickname in XX
and there is no confusion between Agora's woggle and XX's woggle, I would
prefer NOT GUILTY.  (But if I'm wrong or of the minority opinion, ais523 ought
to be whacked with a rubber chicken.)

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by ais523:

woggle called me "ais523" when filing the CFJ, so it's clear that e doesn't
believe
me to have the nickname "woggle" for the purposes of Agora (whereas I do have
that nickname for the purpose of Agora XX, a different nomic). I've also been
quite
clear on the issue, using that name only on a-d, which is a public forum for
Agora
XX. Neither Agora XX nor Ambassador Abuse is Agoran gameplay; they're both
nomics of their own right unconnected with Agora, that happen to use a-d as a
PF. (Although arguably Ambassador Abuse is no longer a nomic, given that I
amended away all the rules that might plausibly be used to amend it.)

I'm known as "callforjudgement" on a great many fora (it's even part of my
email
address), and I believe I've mentioned this fact on Agoran fora, but nobody
seems to have a problem with that. (And Agora doesn't seem to mind me being
called callforjudgement on, say, BlogNomic; BlogNomic did mind so I had to
change, but that's mostly irrelevant to this case.)

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by woggle:

It is possible to simultaneously have multiple nicknames in Agora, especially
shortly after selecting a new nickname. (See, e.g.,
Machiavelli/Italy/Warrigal/....; G./Gravity Circumference Line Deja Vu
Cardboard Duck e^(-kt)).

Clarity being essential to my CFJ, it only makes sense that I would choose the
least confusing available nickname.

========================================================================

Judge Murphy's Arguments:

To my knowledge, ais523 only used this nickname in a-d in messages
pertaining to Agora XX.  It was reasonably simple to distinguish
which messages in a-d pertained to Agora XX, and within that context,
the nickname issue was not significantly more confusing compared to
everything else that was going on there.
