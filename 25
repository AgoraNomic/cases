JUDGEMENT 25 (Wes)
 
   Jim Shea, due to simple point accumulation, was the Winner of Game
2 of eNomic. The scores were then reset, and before the records were 
transfered, David Cogen and Oerjan won (jointly) Game 3 of eNomic,
thus beginning yet another Game (Game 4) with David Cogen as the
Mighty Speaker.  
 
JUDGE
Deb and Bob <thomson@netcom.com>

--------------------

For the sake of continuity, it's a good thing we agree with the common
understanding on this issue.  Jim did win game 2 and David is the new
speaker.
