Panelist woggle's Arguments:

Just because the rules do not define what One True Agora means does
not prevent the judge from attempting to figure that out. If the prior
judge wants to justify that One True Agora does not refer to this
nomic (which certainly seems the best interpretation), then e should
explain what it does refer to.

Therefore, this panel judges REMAND.
