Caller's Arguments

Rule 2429 puts special status on "paragraphs" when considering
whitespace.  However, paragraphs are not defined.

Rule 1728 consists of several nested lists.  Some list items
are separated by a blank line, some list items aren't.  The
first block list (items 1-4) seems like a single paragraph,
while later lists in the Rule seem like multiple paragraphs.  

So how many paragraphs are in Rule 1728, among multiply-nested
lists?  (This is so I know my flexibility as a Rulekeepor for 
formatting lists).


Caller's Evidence

Rule 1728/33 (Power=3)
Dependent Actions

       A rule which purports to allow a person (the performer) to
       perform an action by a set of one or more of the following
       methods (N is 1 unless otherwise specified):

        1) Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no
           greater than 8.  ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this
           method with N = 1.)
        2) With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer.  ("With
           Support" is shorthand for this method with N = 1.)
        3) With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
           with a minimum of 1.
        4) With Notice.

       thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all
       of the following are true:

        a) A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the
           action, unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and
           method(s) (including the value of N for each method), at
           most fourteen days earlier, and (if the action depends on
           objections or notice) at least 4 days earlier.

        b) At least one of the following is true:

             1) The performer is the initiator.

             2) The initiator was authorized to perform the action due
                to holding a rule-defined position now held by the
                performer.

             3) The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
                action depends on support, the performer has supported
                the intent, and the rule authorizing the performance
                does not explicitly prohibit supporters from performing
                it.

        c) Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
           other rules.

        d) If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was
           given in the announcement of intent to perform the action,
           all those conditions are met.

       The actor SHOULD publish a list of supporters if the action
       depends on support, and a list of objectors if it depends on
       objections.


Rule 2429/1 (Power=1)
Bleach

       Replacing a non-zero amount of whitespace with a different
       non-zero amount of whitespace is generally insignificant, except
       for paragraph breaks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Judge o's Arguments:

I find the statement

>    The text of Rule 1728/33 contains exactly 14 paragraphs.

to be FALSE.

A paragraph is a structure of prose, not of whitespace. Style guides show 
huge amounts of variation in the ways of indicating paragraphs using 
whitespace, and no style guide is obviously superior to any other other 
than as the resulting prose can be more or less easily read by its 
intended audience.

One common paragraph style involves leaving empty space between adjacent 
paragraphs, to clearly and visually indicate the divisions in the flow of 
the prose. This is regularly emulated in “plain text” by leaving a whole 
blank line, though in typesetting and design the actual amount of 
whitespace is often more than or less than exactly one line’s worth. This 
style is pervasive in Agora, to the point that I am very tempted to call 
it the preferred Agoran style, but it’s not universal.

Another, less common paragraph style leaves no space between paragraphs, 
and instead decorates the paragraphs themselves in some fashion - by 
indenting them, for example, or by ending the previous paragraph such that 
it avoids filling the line. Again, this visual indicator marks the flow of 
the prose but does not define it, and it is ultimately the body of the 
prose itself that defines the flow of paragraphs.

To determine whether the statement in this CFJ is true, we must look at 
whether the list bullet

>        1) Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no
>           greater than 8.  ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this
>           method with N = 1.)

in isolation comprises a paragraph. If so, and if every list bullet in the 
text of the rule comprises a paragraph of its own, then the rule text does 
indeed have 14 paragraphs. On the other hand, if it does not, then the 
rule text has some other number of paragraphs.

One option is to decide that list bullets and paragraphs are distinct 
kinds of prose structures, and that a section of prose that is one cannot 
possibly be the other. This is the approach taken by modern document 
markup tools, ranging from Docbook and HTML to LaTeX to Word. This 
distinction is unsatisfying, as it does not address the meat of the CFJ 
(which is that the addition or removal of whitespace around a list may 
violate the wording of Rule 2429/1).

Another option is to decide that, as the prose of the first paragraph 
continues uninterrupted past the list, that the list itself is embedded 
within the first paragraph. In no style guide or prose analysis I can find 
are paragraphs nested within paragraphs; if the first paragraph includes 
the list, then no single list bullet can itself be a paragraph.

A final option is to decide that a paragraph break occurs at each place 
where flowing prose switches to a list, and between each list element. 
This appears to lead to absurdities, such as the paragraph

>        b) At least one of the following is true:

in the body of the rule.

Of the three choices, I find the second - that the first paragraph of Rule 
1728/33 reads, in full,

>       A rule which purports to allow a person (the performer) to
>       perform an action by a set of one or more of the following
>       methods (N is 1 unless otherwise specified):

>        2) With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer.  ("With
>           Support" is shorthand for this method with N = 1.)
>        3) With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
>           with a minimum of 1.
>        4) With Notice.
>       thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all
>       of the following are true:

>           objections or notice) at least 4 days earlier.
>        b) At least one of the following is true:
>             1) The performer is the initiator.
>             2) The initiator was authorized to perform the action due
>                to holding a rule-defined position now held by the

>             3) The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
>                action depends on support, the performer has supported

>        c) Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
>           other rules.
>        d) If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was

>           all those conditions are met.

to be the least problematic and most compelling. Embedding other 
structures within paragraphs does not break the paragraph at any edge of 
the embedded structure, or anywhere within the embedded structure.

Note that a paragraph that is as long and as internally interdependent as 
this is not excellent style. This CFJ does not condone the creation of 
such prose, but does acknowledge its existence.

Thus, Rule 1728/33 has exactly two paragraphs, and I find the CFJ to be 
FALSE.

The second paragraph, for completeness, is

>       The actor SHOULD publish a list of supporters if the action
>       depends on support, and a list of objectors if it depends on
>       objections.
