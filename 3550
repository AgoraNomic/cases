Caller's Arguments:

First, my apologies to whichever poor sap gets to judge this, because
you get to do some forensic accounting. I keep fairly complete
records, so feel more than free to request further evidence.

The core of this CFJ is a transaction nichdel performed immediately
prior to the passage of proposal 7867:

However, according to my records, at this time nichdel had a balance
of 2 Shinies. Per rule 2483 (“Economics”) in effect at that time:

Paying 7 Shinies with a balance of 2 Shinies would make nichdel’s
balance -5 Shinies, and therefore the payment is ineffective.

No other payments have ever been made to ASaAA, so its balance was,
and remained, zero.

Subsequently, proposal 7867 passed, which zeroed all players’
balances, and reset Agora’s balance to 1,000 Shinies. (Organization
balances were not affected, a fact which appears to have been
intentional in hindsight.)

Afterwards, after some minor paperwork cleanup, nichdel performed the
following trivially-successful transactions, quoted above:

* Received 50 shinies from Agora via a Welcome Package (nichdel: 50
sh)
* Paid 40 shinies to Agora to create 1 stamp in eir own possession
(nichdel: 10 sh, 1 stamp)
* Paid 1 shiny to ASaAA (nichdel: 9 sh, 1 stamp; ASaAA: 1 sh)

Finally, e attempted to have ASaAA pay em 8 shinies in exchange for a
stamp. E noted this as a single transaction. Since ASaAA does not
have 8 Shinies, by rule 2483:

> Any organization CAN pay Agora, any player, or any other

This payment cannot succeed, and therefore neither can the
transaction it is part of.
