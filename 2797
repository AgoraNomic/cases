==============================  CFJ 2797  ==============================

    If the proposal entitled "Reassign the name" passed, it would
    successfully null-amend a Rule with Power > 1.7.

Caller's Arguments:

It is arguably possible for the proposal to null-amend
rules with Power > 1.7, because a null-amendment doesn't really
"affect the instrument's operation" (R2140), but it may require an
annotation to that rule (see previous CFJ) which could hypothetically
affect its operation.

Judge scshunt's Arguments:

Trivially FALSE; the proposal lacks the Power to amend a Rule of greater
Power.
