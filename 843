        ASSIGNMENT CFJ 843

    The Rules in general should be interpreted so that if a
    sentence says that 'event X happens and event Y
    happens', where X and Y are both modifications of some
    sort to the game state, the word 'and' is _not_ taken to
    mean that Y cannot occur if X does not occur.

Decision & Reasoning Judge:


In the Judgement of CFJ 842, the Judge, a close personal
friend of mine, wrote:

>                                             The relevant
> part of 1469/2 says "If A, then X and Y".  If some other

This generalizes nicely into the Statement of this CFJ,
and suggests that it should be Judged TRUE.  And in general
it seems reasonable to assume that, absent any strong reason
in the rest of the Rule in question to think otherwise,
the connective "and" should be taken to mean, well, "and".
Just as if the Rule had been written "Event X happens."
"Event Y happens." rather than as "Event X happens and
Event Y happens."

Respectfully submitted,

Judge favor
