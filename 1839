=========================  Criminal Case 1839  =========================

    Zefram violated Rule 2149/8. ("A person SHALL NOT make a public
    statement unless e believes in doing so e is telling the truth.") In
    message <20071219230243.GL17928@fysh.org>, Zefram claimed that the
    attempt to register WALRUS was ineffective, since 'WALRUS does not
    adequately identify any particular entity'.

========================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Since WALRUS is the name of a partnership, WALRUS does identify an entity. Of
course, since the WALRUS contract is private, Zefram may merely be ignorant
and foolish, rather than maliciously taking action against WALRUS.

========================================================================

Gratuitous Arguments by Zefram:

It should be clear from my public statements that I was, and am, genuinely
of the opinion that the word "WALRUS" was not adequately defined in the
context of the first attempt to register an entity by that name.

========================================================================

Judge Iammars's Arguments:

Applicable Rules:

Rule 2149/8 (Power=1)
Truthfulness

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement unless e believes
      that in doing so e is telling the truth.  Merely quoting a false
      statement does not constitute making it for the purposes of this
      rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause, or other qualifier
      attached to a statement constitutes part of the statement for
      the purposes of this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is
      what is significant.

Portion of Rule 869/25 (Power=1)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      A person CAN register, unless prevented by the rules, by
      announcing that e registers, wishes to register, requests
      registration, or requests permission to register.

Whenever a player posts on the mail list that someone wants to register, e can
only mean one of two things. The first is that e wants to register emself
under the requested name, the second is that e wants to register another
person under the requested name. Because game custom dictates that a player
doesn't register while e is already registered, it can be reasonably assumed
that pikhq wasn't trying to register himself. Therefore, he must have tried to
register another player, aka a partnership. Registering a partnership requires
that the basis of the partnership be different from the basis of any other
person. Zefram has no way of knowing whether the basis of the partnership is
different from any other person because the basis of WALRUS could be a private
contract, and due to the fact that it's a private contract, Zefram doesn't
know whether it's different than any other basis of a person. Therefore,
Zefram doesn't know whether or not WALRUS successfully registered, so he can't
lie about it being registered. Therefore I judge INNOCENT.
