Caller's Arguments:

  After resignation, Goethe published a Notice of Award,
  which is the event causing Agoran Points to be awarded
  (CFJ 1481).  The budget item under which the points
  are awarded (CN 1) refers to "Claustronomic" but does
  not require Claustronomic to be a Contest.    Nothing
  in the Rules of Claustronomic have caused it to cease
  to exist, despite the fact that it is no longer an
  Agoran Contest.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Goethe's Resignation and notices of award:

> I perform the following two actions in sequence.
> A call for Judgement will Follow.
>
> 1.  I hereby resign from the Agoran Claustronomic Contest
>     (as both Contestmaster and Member).  This does not
>     indicate that I wish to cease being a Claustronomic
>     Player (as defined by Claustronomic).
>
> 2.  I note that Kolja's recent notice of award did not
>     note an Agoran Rule number.  Therefore it was
>     invalid.  I hereby inform myself:
>
>    Elysion is awarded 3 points for being awarded 3
>    Claustronomic Points for the adoption of
>    Claustronomic Proposal 324.
>    (Scorekeepor's Budget CN1, as defined by Rule 2055).
>
>    Elysion is awarded 2 points for being awarded 2
>    Claustronomic Points for the adoption of
>    Claustronomic Proposal 325.
>    (Scorekeepor's Budget CN1, as defined by Rule 2055).

Agoran Rule 1539/4 (Power=1)
Regulations and Membership of Contests

      The regulations of a contest may specify the following:

        a) How a contestmaster is replaced.  No person may become
           contestmaster without eir consent.  If left unspecified,
           the contestmaster cannot change while the contest exists.

        b) Restrictions on players to become contestants.

        c) Conditions under which contestants cease to be contestants.

      No player is bound to obey any regulation or combination of
      regulations that conflict with the Rules.

      A player becomes a contestant, or ceases to be a contestant, by
      notifying the contestmaster.

      A contestmaster may publicly resign at any time, at which time e
      ceases to be contestmaster.


Scorekeepor's Budget Item CN 1:
> >   CN 1:  An Agoran player who is awarded points in Claustronomic
> >          may be awarded the same number of points in Agora.  An
> >          Agoran player who is penalized points in Claustronomic
> >          may be penalized the same number of points in Agora.


CFJ 1481:
   http://zenith.homelinux.net/cotc/viewcase.php?cfj=1481


Rules of Claustronomic as of Goethe's resignation and the
time of this CFJ (Rules ordered by precedence):

Rule 101/0 (Immutable)
    All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect, in
    the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
    Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
    The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-222
    (mutable).

Rule 102/0 (Immutable)
    Initially Rules in the 100's are immutable and Rules in the 200's
    are mutable.  Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is,
    changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable
    or mutable regardless of their numbers, and Rules in the Initial
    Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

Rule 103/0 (Immutable)
    At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
    no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker.  At any
    time there shall be exactly one Speaker.  The term "Player" in
    the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
    Speaker.

Rule 104/1 (Immutable)
    Rule 203 may amend this rule.

    The First Speaker of Claustronomic was Goethe.

Rule 106/0 (Immutable)
    All Rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
    They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
    number of votes and quorum is achieved.

Rule 107/0 (Immutable)
    Any proposed Rule change must be distributed to all Players
    before it it is voted on.  If adopted, it must guide play in the
    form in which it was voted on.

Rule 108/0 (Immutable)
    No Rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
    completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
    explicitly states otherwise.  No Rule change may have retroactive
    application.

Rule 110/0 (Immutable)
    Rule changes that transmute immutable Rules into mutable Rules
    may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among votes
    legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
    stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

Rule 111/0 (Immutable)
    In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable Rule, the
    immutable Rule takes precedence and the mutable Rule shall be
    entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a proposal to
    transmute an immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
    immutable Rule.

Rule 113/0 (Immutable)
    A Player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than
    continue to play or incur a game penalty.  No penalty worse than
    losing, in the judgement of the Player to incur it, may be
    imposed.

Rule 114/0 (Immutable)
    There must always be at least one mutable Rule.  The adoption of
    Rule changes must never become completely inpermissible.

Rule 115/0 (Immutable)
    Rule changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply Rule
    changes are as permissible as other Rule changes.  Even Rule
    changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
    permissible.  No Rule change or type of move is impermissible
    solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
    Rule.

Rule 116/0 (Immutable)
    Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
    and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
    which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
    implicitly permits it.

Rule 301/2 (Immutable)
    Any rule that is enacted shall be given a rule number equal to
    the lowest integer that is greater than any previously assigned
    rule number when it takes full effect.  Any rule that is amended,
    transmuted, or repealed shall keep its rule number.

Rule 105/1 (Mutable)
    A Rule change is any of the following:
      (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or
      (2) the transmutation of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule
          or vice versa.

Rule 109/1 (Mutable)
    The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule change a number for
    reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
    change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
    successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

    The Speaker shall maintain an amendment index for each Rule.  The
    amendment index of a Rule is 0 when it is enacted or otherwise
    unspecified.  The amendment index of a Rule is incremented each
    time the Rule is amended.

Rule 112/1 (Mutable)
    The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
    from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
    magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
    and Rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may
    be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

Rule 201/0 (Mutable)
    Quorum for a proposed Rule change is defined to be 20% of Voters
    at the beginning of the prescribed voting period for that
    proposal.

Rule 202/0 (Mutable)
    All Players begin with 0 points.  Points may not be gained, lost,
    or traded except as explicitly stated in the Rules.

Rule 203/0 (Mutable)
    The winner is the first Voter to achieve 100 (positive) points.
    If more than one Voter achieves this condition simultaneously,
    all such Voters win.  When a game ends in this manner:

        * Rule 104 is amended by appending the sentence "The Nth
          Speaker of Claustronomic was FOO.", where `Nth' is replaced
          by the smallest positive ordinal not already occurring in
          Rule 104, and `FOO' is replaced by the identity of the
          Speaker.

        * If there is only one winner, then that Voter becomes the
          Speaker; otherwise, the Speaker randomly selects one of the
          winners, who becomes the new Speaker.  Afterward, the old
          Speaker becomes a Voter, and shall transfer all necessary
          information (such as outstanding Proposals, score lists,
          etc.) to the new Speaker.

        * All Players' scores are reset to 0.

        * A new game is begun.  All Rules and proposed Rule changes
          retain the status they had at the end of the old game.

Rule 204/0 (Mutable)
    A proposal shall be made by submitting it to the Speaker.  Only
    Voters may make proposals.  As soon as possible after the
    beginning of each week, the Speaker shall assign each currently
    undistributed proposal a number and distribute them along with
    their numbers to all Players.

Rule 205/0 (Mutable)
    The prescribed voting period for a proposal shall be one week,
    beginning at the time the Speaker distributes the proposal to all
    Players.

Rule 206/0 (Mutable)
    Each Voter may vote exactly once per proposal.  The Speaker may
    not vote on any proposal.

Rule 207/0 (Mutable)
    Voters may vote either for or against any proposal within its
    prescribed voting period.  In order to be legally cast, the vote
    must be received by the Speaker by the end of the prescribed
    voting period.  The Speaker may not reveal any votes until the
    end of the prescribed voting period.  Any Voter who does not
    legally vote within the prescribed voting period shall be deemed
    to have abstained.

Rule 208/0 (Mutable)
    As soon as possible after the prescribed voting period on a
    proposal, the Speaker shall reveal all votes legally cast on that
    proposal.  If the Speaker's consent may be required for a
    proposal to be adopted, then the Speaker should indicate at that
    time whether or not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not
    explicitly indicate that e refuses to consent to the proposal, it
    shall be assumed that e consents.

Rule 209/0 (Mutable)
    The required votes for a proposal to be adopted is as follows:

      For a proposal which would directly alter the actions which are
      required of and/or forbidden to the Speaker:
         a) a simple majority of all votes legally cast, if the
            Speaker consents;
         b) a 2/3 majority of all votes legally cast, if the Speaker
            does not consent;

      For all other proposals, a simple majority of votes legally
      cast.

    This Rule defers to Rules which set the required number of votes
    for proposals which propose to transmute a Rule.

Rule 210/0 (Mutable)
    Each adopted Rule change in a distribution takes full effect when
    the Speaker correctly announces the voting results for that
    distribution.

Rule 211/1 (Mutable)
    Upon the adoption of a proposal, Voters who voted against that
    proposal shall receive 2 points apiece.  Upon the adoption of a
    proposal, the Player who made that proposal shall receive as many
    points as the difference between votes cast for and against this
    proposal.

    Upon the defeat of a proposal which achieved quorum, the Player
    who made that proposal shall lose as many points as the
    difference between votes cast against and for this proposal.

    When a proposal fails to achieve quorum, all Voters who did not
    cast a vote on the proposal lose 5 points.

Rule 212/0 (Mutable)
    If two or more mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if two
    or more immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the Rule
    with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.  If at least one
    of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers
    to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes precedence over
    another Rule (or type of Rule), then such provisions shall
    supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.  If
    two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another or
    defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

Rule 213/0 (Mutable)
    If Players disagree about the legality of a move or the
    interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may invoke
    Judgement by submitting a statement for Judgement to the
    Speaker.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this Rule, may be
    created by the insistence of any Player.

    When Judgement is invoked, the Speaker must, as soon as possible,
    select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Speaker must then
    distribute the statement to be Judged, along with the identity of
    the Judge, to all Players.

Rule 214/0 (Mutable)
    If Judgement was invoked by a Voter, then the first Judge to be
    selected to Judge that statement shall be the Speaker.  If
    Judgement was invoked by the Speaker, the first Judge to be
    selected shall be a randomly selected Voter.  In all cases, if a
    Judge beyond the first must be selected to Judge a statement, it
    shall be a randomly selected Voter.  The Voter thus selected may
    not be the Player most recently selected as Judge for that
    statement, nor may e be the Player who invoked Judgement.

Rule 215/1 (Mutable)
    The judge of a statement has ten days from the time e was assigned
    the statement in which to deliver a valid judgement.  If e fails
    to do so within this time, then e is penalized 10 points, and a
    new judge is selected.  E delivers judgement by submitting that
    judgement to the Speaker, who must then distribute it to all
    players as soon as possible.

Rule 216/0 (Mutable)
    A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED.  The
    Judgement may be accompanied by reasons and arguments, but such
    reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.  If a
    Judgement is accompanied by reasons and arguments, the Speaker
    must distribute the reasons and arguments along with the
    Judgement.

Rule 217/0 (Mutable)
    All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
    the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the statement
    to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game custom and the
    spirit of the game before applying other standards.

Rule 218/1 (Mutable)
    In addition to duties which may be listed elsewhere in the Rules,
    the Speaker shall have the following duties:

        -register new Players;

        -maintain a list of all Players and their current scores, and
         make such a list available to all Players;

        -make a random determination whenever such determination is
         required by the Rules.

    In addition to duties which may be listed elsewhere in the Rules,
    the Historian shall have the following duties:

        -maintain a complete list of the current Rules, and make such
         a list available to all Players;

        -maintain a list of delivered judgements, and proposed Rule
         changes for which the voting period has ended;

        -maintain relationships with Agora by holding the position of
         Contestmaster, if necessary and permissible.

    The first Historian shall be whomsoever is the Speaker when this
    Rule takes effect.


Rule 219/0 (Mutable)
    If a Player believes that the Rules are such that further play is
    impossible, or that the legality of a move cannot be determined
    with finality, or that a move appears equally legal and illegal,
    then the Player may invoke Judgement on a statement to that
    effect.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, then the Player who
    invoked Judgement shall be declared the winner of that game, and
    the game ends, with no provision for starting another game.  This
    Rule takes precedence over every other Rule determining the
    winner of the game.

Rule 220/0 (Mutable)
    Each week shall begin on Monday at 00:00 GMT.

Rule 221/1 (Mutable)
    Submitting a message to the official mailing list for this game
    shall be sufficient for distributing the message to all Players.

    The official mailing list is nomic@u.washington.edu.

    The requirement to make information available to all players can
    be met by distributing it to all players at least once every two
    weeks. If such information has not changed since the last
    distribution to all players, no repeat distribution of the
    unchanged information is required.

Rule 302/0 (Mutable)
    April 15 shall be Claustronomic Tax Day. At the beginning of this
    day, each player with a positive number of points shall lose 10%
    of eir points (rounded down).

Rule 303/0 (Mutable)
    A player (the donor) may donate a positive, integral number of
    points N to any other player (the recipient), provided that the
    donor has at least N points, by announcing to the official mailing
    list that e does so. Upon making such an announcement, the donor
    loses N points and the recipient gains N points.

Rule 304/0 (Mutable)
    Any two proposed rule changes are either connected or
    disconnected, defaulting to disconnected.  A player proposing two
    or more rule changes in a single message may connect them by
    declaration.

    Rule changes in a connected component must be distributed
    together, and only go into effect if they are all adopted.

Rule 305/0 (Mutable)
    Upon the creation of this rule, all players who voted for it gain
    30 points.

========================================================================

Judge Michael's Arguments:

As per my argument in CFJ 1517, Claustronomic ceased to exist
(language from Rule 1397) when Goethe resigned as its Contestmaster.
Scorekeepor's budgets can not award points on the basis of points
awards in entities that do not legally exist.

Alternatively, Agoran law says "Claustronomic does not exist", so
equally, Agora law says it is impossible for an Agoran Player to be
awarded points in Claustronomic (text from Budget Item CN 1).

Therefore no awards should have been made because of this Budget
Item.
