========================================================================

Panelist Wooble's Arguments:

With the consent of Goethe and root, I intend to have the panel judge
REMAND with instructions to consider the effects of the ratification
of the Registrar's report.

========================================================================

Panelist root's Arguments:

I consent to this, on condition that "Registrar's report" is replaced
with "Assessor's report".  The Assessor's report has been ratified
within that time period; the Registrar's report has not.
