   Assessor Kelly has committed a total of four (4) distinct Class D
   Crimes, in failing to publish the results of Voting on Proposals
   2574, 2575, 2576 and 2577 within the time alloted em to do so.

======================================================================
Decision of Judge Steve:  TRUE

I Judge the Statement to be TRUE. The relevant Rules are R208/2,
which requires the Assessor to publish results as soon as possible
after the end of the Voting Period on a given Proposal, and R1023/6,
which imposes the one week time limit on asap actions, and makes
failure to adhere to that limit a Class D Crime. The relevant evidence
is Kelly's Assessor's Report, of which I include an excerpt:

>Assessor's Report: 21 Apr 1996 18:04:08
