Caller's Arguments:

R104 states that Michael Norrish is the speaker for the first game.
As there are no references to any other game being started nor is
there any indication in the rules that this is not the first game,
Micheal must be the speaker.  Also no rule defining the role of
speaker or the transferring of speaker has a power of 3 or greater,
therefor R104 coupled with R101 must rule.

========================================================================

Caller's Evidence:

Rule 104/0 (Power=3)
First Speaker

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.



Rule 101/1 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in
      effect, in the form in which they are currently in effect.
      However, a Player besides the Speaker may always deregister
      rather than continue to play.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
      permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permit it.  Any change to the game state which would
      make it impossible to make arbitrary modifications to the Rules
      by any combination of actions by Players does not occur, any
      Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of
      the first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
      (Immutable) and 201-219 (Mutable).

========================================================================

Judge Kolja's Arguments:

The consistent reading of 104 is that it is a historical remnant of
the early days of Agora with no impact on today's playing
practice. This is consistent with, e.g., the last paragraph of 101
which contains a similar historical remnant.

The term 'game' is currently not defined explicitly in the rules. If
it is used at all (often in the context of "game state") it refers to
Agora as an ongoing activity, because we currently do not have a
concept of wins deviding things into separate "games". In particular,
there is no concept in the rules of a series of enumerable (first,
second etc) games, the concept (in 2075) of winning "the game"
notwithstanding (note that even in this context there is no mentioning
of an "end of game", "next game" or the like).

The term "first" or "nth" game used to mean the activities in the
nomic until the next win, as after a win a "new game" in some sense was
started (see exhibit A below).

There have been many wins since 104 defined the speaker, some of which
triggered the start of new (second, third etc) games according to the
rules valid at the time, and many changes of the speaker as defined at
the time. These were legal and took place ok. If anyone wants to
challenge this statement, you are welcome to appeal this judgement;
until then I don't think it is necessary for me or someone else to dig
out the detailed historical evidence supporting this statement.

One may argue that 104 should have been abolished or changed along
with the other changes that concerned the concept of 'games' as
defined, countable periods between 'wins'. This argument could be
continued to say that due to the continued presence and validity of
104, and applying its text without regards to its history, we are now
in the 'first game' of Agora.

However, I feel that it is quite strongly in keeping with common
sense, game custom unchallenged for many years and the best interest
of the game as required of a judge by 217 no to go this way and claim
that we have messed up the identity of the speaker for ages (as a
judgement of TRUE would wreck Agora completely and declare most of its
history illegal).

========================================================================

Judge Kolja's Evidence:

Exhibit A: Rule 203 from the original ruleset (thanks to Michael for
providing this one!):

203.  The winner is the first Voter to achieve 100 (positive) points.
      If more than one Voter achieves this condition simultaneously,
      all such Voters win.
      When a game ends in this manner:
        -If there is only one winner, that Voter becomes the Speaker,
         and the old Speaker becomes a Voter
        -If there is more than one winner, the Speaker randomly
         selects one of the winners, who becomes the new Speaker, and
         the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        -All players' scores are reset to 0.
        -A new game is begun.  All rules and proposed rule changes
         retain the status they had at the end of the old game.

Exhibit B: rule 101 with references to currently undefined concepts
like 'mutable' and 'immutable'

Rule 101/1 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in
      effect, in the form in which they are currently in effect.
      However, a Player besides the Speaker may always deregister
      rather than continue to play.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
      permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permit it.  Any change to the game state which would
      make it impossible to make arbitrary modifications to the Rules
      by any combination of actions by Players does not occur, any
      Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of
      the first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
      (Immutable) and 201-219 (Mutable).

Exhibit C: rule 2075

Rule 2075/1 (Power=1)
Winning Hands

      The Deckmastor's Budget shall contain between one and three
      Winning Hands, each of which is a list of cards with a hand size
      at least two greater than the Maximum Hand Size.

      If a Gambler's Hand is identical to a winning hand at any
      particular moment, any Gambler has 72 hours from that moment to
      announce that a Gambler holds or has held a winning hand.

      If the announcement is false, the Deckmastor shall, as soon as
      possible, transfer 1 card at random from the announcing
      Gambler's Hand to the Deck.

      If the announcement is true, the holding Gambler Wins the Game,
      and is awarded the boon of Pokerface and the defined regular
      Patent Title Champion.

      Exactly one week after a true announcement, the Flux of all
      Gamblers except the Deck shall become frozen.  The Deckmastor
      shall transfer random cards from the hands of each frozen
      gambler to the deck, until each frozen gambler has either (a) a
      hand size equal to or less than the Minimum hand size or (b) no
      cards.  Then, the Deckmaster shall deal cards to the winner up
      to the maximum hand size.  When these tasks have been peformed,
      the Flux of every Gambler shall become free.

      If no one has won the game in the last six months, then any
      Gambler may announce a Skunk, which shall trigger the effects of
      a true announcement of a win above, except that no boon shall be
      awarded nor shall extra winner's cards be dealt.
