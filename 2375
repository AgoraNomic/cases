========================================================================

Judge woggle's Arguments:

GUILTY / APOLOGY - exception, batch, late, docket, 2200, 2202, 2203.

========================================================================

Appellant omd's Arguments:

I intend with 2 support to appeal the questions on sentencing in CFJs
2373 and 2375, on the grounds that failing to assign judges to some
old cases does not deserve a formal apology unless someone
demonstrates that they were actually disadvantaged by the lateness.

========================================================================

Judge woggle's Arguments:

In light of R2339, I rejudge DISCHARGE on sentencing in CFJ 2373 and
DISCHARGE on sentencing in CFJ 2375.
