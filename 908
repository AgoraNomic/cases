Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

FALSE, trivially. When an Extra Vote is cast on a Disinterested
Proposal, other actions might occur at the same time that cause the
transfer of EVs from the caster's Treasury.

Getting back to what is in fact meant, Rule 206/8 states that the
casting of votes may only be achieved by the casting of Extra
Votes. To me this means that the casting of the vote is a result of
the casting of the Extra Vote, not the other way around. Therefore the
transfer of the Extra Vote is not a result of the voting (but
something having the same outside cause, namely the casting of the
Extra Vote). Thus, even if the above trivial reason would not hold, I
would still have judged FALSE.

Thus humbly submitted to the courts on Wednesday 12 March 1997,

Evidence:

Rule 206/8 (MI=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to
      be a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a
      Proposal unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities
      designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
      Entities. Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary. The casting of any votes may only
      be achieved by the casting of Extra Votes, as specified in other
      Rules.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1623/4 (MI=1)
Disinterested Proposals

      A Proposal is Disinterested if the text of the message wherein
      it is submitted explicitly states that it is a Disinterested
      Proposal.  Whenever a Disinterested Proposal is distributed, it
      must be clearly marked as such.

      No transfer of Currencies, Blots or other Entities which occur
      as a result of voting upon or adoption of such a Proposal, other
      than those caused by the Proposal taking effect, shall take
      place, unless the Rule which requires the transfer explicitly
      states that the transfer applies to Disinterested Proposals.

      All Amendments within a Disinterested Proposal shall be
      Unattributed.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule seeking to effect
      transfers prohibited by this Rule.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Reasoning : the Disinterested Proposal Rule states that no transfer is
allowed "as a result of Voting on a DP". Transfers of EVs which occur
when casting Extra Votes are a result of Voting on the Proposal on
which they're cast; therefore they are disallowed.
